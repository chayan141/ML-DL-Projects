And night is falling.\"', 'Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \"It does that every day about this time. Are you', 'unmanned by the dark, Gared?\"', \"Will could see the tightness around Gared's mouth, the barely sup\", 'pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the', \"Night's Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than\", 'that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a', 'nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.', 'Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all', 'the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it', 'afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the', 'southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him.', 'Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles', 'rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from', 'the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had', 'come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the', 'trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something', 'cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride', 'hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander.', 'Especially not a commander like this one.', 'Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome', 'youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the', 'knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black', 'woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of', \"black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch for less than\", 'half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe', 'was concerned.', 'His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \"Bet he killed them all himself,', 'he did,\" Gared told the barracks over wine, \"twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.\" They had', 'all shared the laugh.', 'It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop', 'his garron. Gared must have felt the same.', '\"Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,\" Gared said.', '\"They\\'re dead. They shan\\'t trouble us no more. There\\'s hard riding before us. I don\\'t like this weather. If', \"it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow's the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice\", 'storm, my lord?\"', 'The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted', 'Page 2', '', 'way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt', 'him when he looked like that. \"Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.\"', \"Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night's Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders\", \"had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters' own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters' own bucks, and\", 'it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as', 'silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.', '\"The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,\" Will said. \"I got close as I', \"dared. There's eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to\", \"against the rock. The snow's pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but\", 'the firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.\"', '\"Did you see any blood?\"', '\"Well, no,\" Will admitted.', '\"Did you see any weapons?\"', '\"Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron.', 'It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.\"', '\"Did you make note of the position of the bodies?\"', 'Will shrugged. \"A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like.\"', '\"Or sleeping,\" Royce suggested.', '\"Fallen,\" Will insisted. \"There\\'s one woman up an ironwood, halfhid in the branches. A far-eyes.\" He', 'smiled thinly. \"I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn\\'t moving neither.\"', 'Despite himself, he shivered.', '\"You have a chill?\" Royce asked.', '\"Some,\" Will muttered. \"The wind, m\\'lord.\"', 'The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and', 'Royce\\'s destrier moved restlessly. \"What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\" Ser', 'Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak.', '\"It was the cold,\" Gared said with iron certainty. \"I saw men freeze', 'last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and', 'how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you', 'quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of', 'mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it', \"gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don't have the strength to fight it. It's easier\", \"just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don't feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and\", 'drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it\\'s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.\"', '\"Such eloquence, Gared,\" Ser Waymar observed. \"I never suspected you had it in you.\"', 'Page 3', '', '\"I\\'ve had the cold in me too, lordling.\" Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look', 'at the stumps where his ears had been. \"Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got', 'off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.\"', 'Ser Waymar shrugged. \"You ought dress more warmly, Gared.\"', 'Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester', 'Aemon had cut the ears away. \"We\\'ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.\" He pulled', 'up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen.', '\"If Gared said it was the cold . . .\" Will began.', '\"Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?\"', '\"Yes, m\\'lord.\" There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the', 'man driving at?', '\"And how did you find the Wall?\"', '\"Weeping,\" Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. \"They', 'couldn\\'t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn\\'t cold enough.\"', 'Royce nodded. \"Bright lad. We\\'ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now', 'and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me', 'remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.\" The knight\\'s smile was cocksure.', '\"Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.\"', 'And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey.', 'Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light', 'snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its', 'crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier', 'snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling.', 'Gared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode.', 'Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to', 'black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light.', '\"We can make a better pace than this, surely,\" Royce said when the moon was full risen.', '\"Not with this horse,\" Will said. Fear had made him insolent. \"Perhaps my lord would care to take the', 'lead?\"', 'Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.', 'Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled.', 'Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted.', 'Page 4', '', '\"Why are you stopping?\" Ser Waymar asked.', '\"Best go the rest of the way on foot, m\\'lord. It\\'s just over that ridge.\"', 'Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through', 'the trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive.', '\"There\\'s something wrong here,\" Gared muttered.', 'The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. \"Is there?\"', '\"Can\\'t you feel it?\" Gared asked. \"Listen to the darkness.\"', \"Will could feel it. Four years in the Night's Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it?\", '\"Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?\" When Gared did not', 'answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well', 'away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the', 'moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the', 'look of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger.', '\"The trees press close here,\" Will warned. \"That sword will tangle you up, m1ord. Better a knife.\"', '\"If I need instruction, I will ask for it,\" the young lord said. \"Gared, stay here. Guard the horses.\"', 'Gared dismounted. \"We need a fire. I\\'ll see to it.\"', '\"How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.\"', '\"There\\'s some enemies a fire will keep away,\" Gared said. \"Bears and direwolves and ... and other', 'things . . .\"', 'Ser Waymar\\'s mouth became a hard line. \"No fire.\"', \"Gared's hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight.\", 'For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip', 'discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the', \"lordling's life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard.\", 'Finally Gared looked down. \"No fire,\" he muttered, low under his breath.', 'Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away. \"Lead on,\" he said to Will.', 'Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found', 'his vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy,', 'slick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him,', \"he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling's ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as\", 'reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak.', 'The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest', 'branches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and', 'Page 5', '', 'looked down on the empty clearing below.', 'His heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the', 'clearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little half-frozen stream.', 'Everything was just as it had been a few hours ago.', 'They were gone. All the bodies were gone.', '\"Gods!\" he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He', 'stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up,', 'outlined nobly against the stars for all to see.', '\"Get down!\" Will whispered urgently. \"Something\\'s wrong.\"', 'Royce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. \"Your dead men seem to have', 'moved camp, Will.\"', \"Will's voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes\", 'swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed', 'battle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon . . .', '\"On your feet, Will,\" Ser Waymar commanded. \"There\\'s no one here. I won\\'t have you hiding under a', 'bush.\"', 'Reluctantly, Will obeyed.', 'Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. \"I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on', 'my first ranging. We will find these men.\" He glanced around. \"Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a', 'fire.\"', 'Will turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him.', 'He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with', 'sap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered', 'a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his', 'teeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort.', 'Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, \"Who goes there?\" Will heard uncertainty in the challenge.', 'He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched.', 'The woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl.', 'The Others made no sound.', 'Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his', 'head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind,', 'scratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the', 'words seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection', 'on the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all?', '\"Will, where are you?\" Ser Waymar called up. \"Can you see anything?\" He was turning in a slow circle,', 'suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see.', 'Page 6', '', '\"Answer me! Why is it so cold?\"', 'It was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard against the trunk of the', 'sentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.', 'A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and', 'hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was', 'white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the', 'trees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took.', 'Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss.', '\"Come no farther,\" the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy\\'s. He threw the long sable cloak', 'back over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had', 'stopped. It was very cold.', 'The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No', 'human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of', 'crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the', 'thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor.', 'Ser Waymar met him bravely. \"Dance with me then.\" He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His', 'hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was', \"a boy no longer, but a man of the Night's Watch.\", 'The Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like', 'ice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal.', 'For a heartbeat he dared to hope.', 'They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser', 'Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had', 'to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the', 'silence.', 'The pale sword came shivering through the air.', 'Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high,', 'thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a', 'third, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again.', 'Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting', 'patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to', 'interfere.', 'Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished', 'keening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight.', \"His blade was white with frost; the Other's danced with pale blue light.\", \"Then Royce's parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The\", 'young lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets', 'seemed red as fire where they touched the snow. Ser', 'Page 7', '', \"Waymar's fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red.\", 'The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on', 'a winter lake, and the words were mocking.', 'Ser Waymar Royce found his fury. \"For Robert!\" he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the', 'frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight', \"behind it. The Other's parry was almost lazy.\", 'When the blades touched, the steel shattered.', 'A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the', 'shards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood', 'welled between his fingers.', 'The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose and fell, all in a', 'deathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed', 'his eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles.', 'When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty.', 'He stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the black sky.', 'Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down.', \"Royce's body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had been slashed in a\", 'dozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy.', 'He found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck', 'by lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof.', 'Gared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester', 'Aemon. Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry.', 'Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.', 'His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of', 'his left eye.', 'The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw.', 'The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed', 'his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with', 'blood, yet the touch was icy cold.', 'BRAN', 'The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set', 'forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with', 'excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his', 'Page 8', '', \"brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran's life.\", 'The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword', \"sworn to Mance Rayder, the Kingbeyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He\", 'remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and', 'slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and', 'drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible', 'half-human children.', \"But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and\", 'scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in', \"black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.\", 'The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut', 'down from the wall and', 'dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his', \"pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he'd seen all this before. A faint wind blew\", 'through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf', 'racing across an ice-white field.', \"Bran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard\", 'was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes', 'this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of', \"the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father's face, Bran thought, and\", 'donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.', 'There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could', 'not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen', 'dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down', 'onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth', 'the sword. \"Ice,\" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\\'s hand, and taller even than', 'Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian', 'steel.', 'His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He', 'took hold of Ice with both hands and said, \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of', 'his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and', 'Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of', 'the North, I do sentence you to die.\" He lifted the greatsword high above his head.', 'Bran\\'s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And', 'don\\'t look away. Father will know if you do.\"', 'Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.', \"His father took off the man's head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red\", 'as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not', 'take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.', \"The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy's feet. Theon was a lean, dark\", 'Page 9', '', 'youth of nineteen who found', 'everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away.', '\"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\\'s shoulder, and Bran', 'looked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand', 'at justice.', 'It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was', 'higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to', 'keep up with their horses.', '\"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\\'s', 'coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the', 'least.\"', '\"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his', 'eyes, Stark.\" Jon\\'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not', 'see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was', 'muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.', 'Robb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\"', '\"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the', 'trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of', 'snow as they went.', \"Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man's eyes, and he was\", \"thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb's laughter receded, and the woods grew silent\", 'again.', 'So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride', 'beside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly.', '\"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great', 'warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he', 'was afraid.\"', '\"What do you think?\" his father asked.', 'Bran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\"', '\"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\"', '\"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\"', 'His lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker,', \"a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he\", 'is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was', 'not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\"', 'Page 10', '', 'Bran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly.', '\"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way.', 'The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man', \"who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to\", 'look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does', 'not deserve to die.', '\"One day, Bran, you will be Robb\\'s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your', 'king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither', 'must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\"', 'That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at', 'them. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again.', 'Jory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\"', '\"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\"', 'He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.', 'They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late', 'summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so', 'the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited', 'voices.', 'The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven', 'ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and', 'joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control', 'of his horse as he reached for his sword.', 'Jory\\'s sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him.', 'Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can\\'t hurt you,\" he said. \"She\\'s dead,', 'Jory.\"', 'Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them', 'dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.', 'By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\"', 'Greyjoy was saying.', '\"A wolf,\" Robb told him.', '\"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\"', \"Bran's heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers' side.\", 'Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy', \"grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume.

They grow larger than the other kind.\"', 'Theon Greyjoy said, \"There\\'s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\"', '\"I see one now,\" Jon replied.', \"Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb's arms. He\", 'gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed.

Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\"', 'Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a', 'second pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup', 'to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.', '\"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\"', '\"It is a sign,\" Jory said.', 'Father frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched', 'under his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\"', '\"There\\'s something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even', 'asked. \"There, just under the jaw.,,', \"His father knelt and groped under the beast's head with his hand.\", 'He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with', 'blood.', 'A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to', 'speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.', 'His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I\\'m surprised she lived long', 'enough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell.', '\"Maybe she didn\\'t,\" Jory said. \"I\\'ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups', 'came.\"', '\"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\"', '\"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\"', 'Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.', '\"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\"', 'The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It\\'s', 'mine.\"', 'Page 12', '', '\"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father,', 'like the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\"', '\"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen\\'s son.', '\"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said.', 'Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly,', 'son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\"', '\"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his', 'father.', 'Robb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik\\'s red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small', 'litter, only two live pups. She\\'ll have milk enough.\"', '\"She\\'ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\"', '\"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal.

The direwolf is the sigil of your', 'House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\"', \"Bran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart\", 'at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right', 'only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls,', 'included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom', 'decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.', 'Their father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly.', '\"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\"', 'Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself,', 'Father,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\"', '\"Me too!\" Bran echoed.', 'The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not', \"have you wasting the servants' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is\", 'that understood?\"', 'Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.', '\"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing', 'to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize', 'them, or train them badly.

By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home.', 'Bran was wondering what to name him.', 'Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.', '\"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked.', '\"Can\\'t you hear it?\"', 'Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering', 'of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.', '\"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him', 'dismount where the direwolf lay', 'dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.', '\"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said.', '\"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the', 'litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran', 'thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.', '\"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\"', 'Jon Snow gave his father\\'s ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs', 'to me.\"', 'CATELYN', 'Catelyn had never liked this godswood.', 'She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood', 'there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling', 'streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers.', 'Page 14', '', 'The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old', 'forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and', 'decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green', 'needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close', 'together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath', 'the soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no', 'names.', \"But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man's life, afterward he\", 'would seek the quiet of the godswood.', 'Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of', 'Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had', 'names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents.', 'Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices', 'raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk', 'or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept.', 'For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of', 'the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless,', 'faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.', 'At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black', 'and cold. \"The heart tree,\" Ned called it. The weirwood\\'s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red,', 'like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features', 'long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those', 'eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were', \"true; they had watched the castle's granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the\", 'forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men', 'across the narrow sea.', 'In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the', 'Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had', 'its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face.', 'Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword', 'Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of', 'humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the', 'weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \"Ned,\" she called softly.', 'He lifted his head to look at her. \"Catelyn,\" he said. His voice was distant and formal. \"Where are the', 'children?\"', 'He would always ask her that. \"In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\" She spread her', 'cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood.

Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory,', 'promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark', 'words. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners; were.', '\"The man died well, I\\'ll give him that,\" Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it', 'lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \"I was glad for Bran\\'s sake.', 'You would have been proud of Bran.\"', '\"I am always proud of Bran,\" Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the', 'rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the', 'forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been', 'forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their', 'metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was', 'forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in', 'the North.', '\"He was the fourth this year,\" Ned said grimly. \"The poor man was half-mad.

That boy of', 'hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\"', '\"Would that I could,\" Catelyn said. \"The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek', 'you out.\"', 'It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the', 'understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \"Robert is coming here?\" When she nodded, a smile', 'broke across his face.', 'Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the', 'snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at', 'this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \"I knew that would please you,\" she said. \"We', 'should send word to your brother on the Wall.\"', '\"Yes, of course,\" he agreed. \"Ben will want to be here.

He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his', 'pale lilac eyes. \"The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\"', 'Dany said nothing.

Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked.', 'Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real', 'gold. \"May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\"', 'the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow', 'teeth through the gold of his beard. \"She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\" he told her brother. \"Drogo', 'will be enraptured.\"', '\"She\\'s too skinny,\" Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly', 'behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard,', 'gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that', 'Illyrio had lent him, and said, \"Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\"', '\"She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, \" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \"Look at', 'her. That silvergold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . .', 'and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.\" When', 'he released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling.', 'Page 21', '', '\"I suppose,\" her brother said doubtfully. \"The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . .\"', '\"Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,\" Illyrio said.', 'Anger flashed in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. \"Do you take me for a fool?\"', 'The magister bowed slightly. \"I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My', 'apologies if I have given offense.\" He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers.', \"The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio's elaborately carved palanquin. Two\", 'servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a', 'dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains.', \"Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio's pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.\", 'Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the', 'narrow sea. \"We won\\'t need his whole khalasar, \" Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his', 'borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \"Ten thousand, that would be', 'enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise', 'for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do.', 'The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for', 'their king.\" He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \"They do, don\\'t they?\"', '\"They are your people, and they love you well,\" Magister Illyrio said amiably. \"In holdfasts all across the', 'realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the', 'day of your return from across the water.\" He gave a massive shrug. \"Or so my agents tell me.\"', 'Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but', \"she mistrusted Illyrio's sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding\", 'eagerly, however. \"I shall kill the Usurper myself,\" he promised, who', 'had never killed anyone, \"as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what', 'he did to my father.\"', '\"That would be most fitting,\" Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around', 'his full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the', 'night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again.', 'The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown', 'with pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities', 'were always generous with the horselords. \"It is not that we fear these barbarians,\" Illyrio would explain', 'with a smile. \"The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests', 'promise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\"', 'Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards.', 'He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the', 'spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to', 'him in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the', 'gates.', \"Dany noticed that her brother's hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He\", 'Page 22', '', 'looked almost as frightened as she felt. \"Insolent eunuch,\" Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up', 'toward the manse.', 'Magister Illyrio\\'s words were honey. \"Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have', 'enemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the', 'Usurper would pay well for your head.\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" Viserys said darkly. \"He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us', 'everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.\"', 'The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help', 'Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched', 'hard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet.', 'Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon.', 'They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria.', 'Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath', 'an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \"Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third', 'of his Name,\" he called in a high, sweet voice, \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men,', 'Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of', 'Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\"', 'They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the', 'leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords,', 'big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and', 'braided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and', 'Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer', 'Isles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden', 'start of fear, that she was the only woman there.', 'Illyrio whispered to them. \"Those three are Drogo\\'s bloodriders, there,\" he said. \"By the pillar is Khal', 'Moro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the', 'man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\"', 'The last name caught Daenerys. \"A knight?\"', '\"No less.\" Illyrio smiled through his beard. \"Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\"', '\"What is he doing here?\" she blurted.', '\"The Usurper wanted his head,\" Illyrio told them. \"Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a', \"Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night's Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as\", 'he likes with his own chattel.\"', '\"I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,\" her brother said. Dany found herself', 'looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit.', 'Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the', 'likeness of a black bear standing on two legs.', 'She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio', 'Page 23', '', 'placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \"Over there, sweet princess,\" he whispered, \"there is the khal', 'himself.\"', 'Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew', 'she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to', 'wed her before the night was done.', 'The slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in', \"the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio's menagerie. He was younger\", \"than she'd thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios\", 'bound with gold and bronze rings.', '\"I must go and make my submissions,\" Magister Illyrio said. \"Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\"', 'Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that', 'they hurt. \"Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\"', \"Drogo's braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as\", 'he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of', 'his thighs.', '\"You see how long it is?\" Viserys said. \"When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids', 'in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the', 'Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\"', 'Dany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her', 'brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man', 'frightened her. \"I don\\'t want to be his queen,\" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \"Please, please,', 'Viserys, I don\\'t want to, I want to go home.\"', '\"Home?\" He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \"How are we to go home, sweet', 'sister? They took our home from us!\" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into', 'her skin. \"How are we to go home?\" he repeated, meaning King\\'s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the', 'realm they had lost.', \"Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio's estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her\", 'brother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door', 'had not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \"I don\\'t know she', 'said at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes.', '\"I do,\" he said sharply. \"We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo\\'s army, that is how', 'we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\" He smiled at her. \"I\\'d let his whole', 'khalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it', 'took to get my army. Be grateful it is', 'only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and', 'he will not see you crying.\"', 'Dany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo', 'over to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand.', 'Page 24', '', '\"Smile,\" Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \"And stand up straight. Let', 'him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\"', 'Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight.', 'EDDARD', 'The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred', 'strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen', 'golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of', 'Baratheon.', 'Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and', 'there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown', 'prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister.', 'Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the', 'Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a', 'familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \"Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of', 'yours.\" The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \"You have not changed at all.\"', 'Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a', \"throne, the Lord of Storm's End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden's fantasy.\", 'Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered', \"helmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He'd had a giant's strength too, his weapon\", 'of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and', 'blood had clung to him like perfume.', 'Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last', \"seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy's rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had\", 'joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had', \"stood side by side in Greyjoy's fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord's surrender\", 'and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard', 'as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls,', 'but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.', 'Yet Robert was Ned\\'s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \"Your Grace. Winterfell is', 'yours.\"', 'By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts.', \"Robert's queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which\", 'they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft', \"horses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen's ring,\", 'while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward,', 'introduced, and approved of by both sides.', 'No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \"Take me', 'down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\"', 'Page 25', '', 'Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other', 'words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was', 'tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more', 'than that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she', 'had said no more.', 'They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone', 'steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \"I was starting to think we would never reach', 'Winterfell,\" Robert complained as they descended. \"In the south, the way they talk about my Seven', 'Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\"', '\"I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?\"', 'Robert snorted. \"Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent', 'inn north of the Neck. I\\'ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all yourpeople?\"', '\"Likely they were too shy to come out,\" Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold', 'breath from deep within the earth. \"Kings are a rare sight in the north.\"', 'Robert snorted. \"More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\" The king put one hand on', 'the wall to steady himself as they descended.', '\"Late summer snows are common enough,\" Ned said. \"I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually', 'mild.\"', '\"The Others take your mild snows,\" Robert swore. \"What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to', 'think.\"', '\"The winters are hard,\" Ned admitted. \"But the Starks will endure. We always have.\"', '\"You need to come south,\" Robert told him. \"You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden', 'there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they', \"explode in your mouth-melons, peaches, fireplums, you've never tasted such sweetness. You'll see, I\", \"brought you some. Even at Storm's End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can\", 'barely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with', 'food, the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is', 'fat and drunk and rich.\" He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \"And the girls, Ned!\"', 'he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the', \"river, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it's too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in\", \"these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it's all the same when they start\", 'sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\" The king laughed happily.', 'Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his', 'pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help', 'but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time', 'they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness', 'of the crypt.', '\"Your Grace,\" Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and', 'Page 26', '', 'lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite', 'pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the', 'pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained', 'their mortal remains. \"She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\"', 'He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It', 'was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they', 'walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses', 'were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into', 'eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the', 'stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by.', 'By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of', 'Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing,', 'leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those', 'ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard', 'as the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn', 'allegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North.', 'Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but', 'beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him', 'and his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \"Here,\" he told his king.', 'Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head.', \"There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned's father, had a long, stern face. The\", 'stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across', 'his lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.', 'Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a', 'few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him', 'die. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule.', 'Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his', 'heart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride.', '\"She was more beautiful than that,\" the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna\\'s face, as if', 'he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \"Ah, damn it, Ned, did', 'you have to bury her in a place like this?\" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \"She deserved', 'more than darkness . . .\"', '\"She was a Stark of Winterfell,\" Ned said quietly. \"This is her place.\"', '\"She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to', 'wash her clean.\"', '\"I was with her when she died,\" Ned reminded the king. \"She wanted to come home, to rest beside', 'Brandon and Father.\" He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled', 'of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a', 'Page 27', '', \"whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister's eyes. Ned remembered the\", 'way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose', 'petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still', 'holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his.', 'Ned could recall none of it. \"I bring her flowers when I can,\" he said. \"Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\"', 'The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh.', '\"I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\"', '\"You did,\" Ned reminded him.', '\"Only once,\" Robert said bitterly.', 'They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his', 'warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate', 'was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The', 'waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and', \"again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it.\", 'When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies', 'scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor.', '\"In my dreams, I kill him every night,\" Robert admitted. \"A thousand deaths will still be less than he', 'deserves.\"', 'There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \"We should return, Your Grace. Your', 'wife will be waiting.\"', '\"The Others take my wife,\" Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his', 'footsteps falling heavily. \"And if I hear \\'Your Grace\\' once more, I\\'ll have your head on a spike. We are', 'more to each other than that.\"', '\"I had not forgotten,\" Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \"Tell me about Jon.\"', 'Robert shook his head. \"I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son\\'s', 'name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he', 'was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\" He paused beside a pillar,', 'before the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \"I loved that old man.\"', '\"We both did.\" Ned paused a moment. \"Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\"', 'Robert\\'s mouth gave a bitter twist. \"Not well, in truth,\" he admitted. \"I think losing Jon has driven the', 'woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster', 'him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave', 'him to be raised by women?\"', 'Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken.', 'Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \"The wife has lost the husband,\"', 'he said carefully. \"Perhaps-the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\"', '\"Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\" the king swore. \"Lord Tywin had never taken', 'a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She', 'Page 28', '', 'refused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei', 'was furious.\" He sighed deeply. \"The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am', 'sworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\"', '\"I will take him as ward, if you wish,\" Ned said. \"Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were', 'close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\"', '\"A generous offer, my friend,\" the king said, \"but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent.', 'Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\"', '\"I have more concern for my nephew\\'s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\" Ned declared.', '\"That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.\" Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs', 'and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black', 'beard. \"Ah, Ned,\" he said, \"you are still too serious.\" He put a massive arm around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"I', \"had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there's no need for it. Come, walk with\", 'me.\"', 'They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed.', 'The king kept his arm around Ned\\'s shoulder. \"You must have wondered why I finally came north to', 'Winterfell, after so long.\"', 'Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \"For the joy of my company, surely,\" he said', 'lightly. \"And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to', 'those who man it. The Night\\'s Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says-\"', '\"No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\" Robert said. \"The Wall has stood for what,', 'eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult', 'times. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of', 'the East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\"', '\"His son . . .\" Ned began.', '\"His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,\" Robert said brusquely. \"No more.\"', 'That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came', 'unbidden. \"The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\"', '\"Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\" Robert said. \"I have this year to', 'think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\"', '\"In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father\\'s sake if not his own. Surely you', 'owe, Jon that much for his service.\"', 'The king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"Jon\\'s service was the duty he', 'owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the', 'father. A mere boy cannot hold the east.\" Then his tone softened. \"Enough of this. There is a more', 'important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\" Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \"I have', 'need of you, Ned.\"', '\"I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\" They were words he had to say, and so he said them,', 'Page 29', '', 'apprehensive about what might come next.', 'Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. \"Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good', \"years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King's Landing, not up here at the end of\", 'the world where you are no damned use to anybody.\" Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment', 'as melancholy as a Stark. \"I swear to', 'you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and', 'counting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair', 'and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or', 'land or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers', \"and fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don't dare tell me the truth, and the other\", \"half can't find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but\", '\"I understand,\" Ned said softly.', 'Robert looked at him. \"I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\" He smiled. \"Lord', 'Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\"', 'Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for', 'coming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He', \"spoke with the king's voice, commanded the king's armies, drafted the king's laws. At times he even sat\", \"upon the Iron Throne to dispense king's justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise\", 'indisposed.

He was certain that his companions were more', \"entertaining than the king's offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their\", 'entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon', 'had gotten a good long look at them all.', 'His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara', 'gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes.

The king was a great disappointment', 'to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the', 'fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard,', 'sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups.', 'After them came the children.

Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \"Hungry again?\"', 'he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a', 'leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his', 'legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their', 'wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one', 'Page 32', '', 'had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too.', 'His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and', 'watched his direwolf devour the chicken.', 'Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls.

The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up,', 'silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three', 'times the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood', 'over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought', 'better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went', 'back to his meal.', 'Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him,', 'nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.', '\"Is this one of the direwolves I\\'ve heard so much of?\" a familiar voice asked close at hand.', 'Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had', 'ruffled the wolf s. \"Yes,\" he said. \"His name is Ghost.\"', \"One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he'd been telling to make room at the table for their lord's\", \"brother.

How many cups have you had, Jon?\"', 'Jon smiled.', 'Ben Stark laughed. \"As I feared. Ah, well.

That, and', 'because he\\'s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\"', '\"There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\" Benjen Stark gave Jon a', 'long look. \"Don\\'t you usually eat at table with your brothers?\"', '\"Most times,\" Jon answered in a flat voice. \"But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the', 'royal family to seat a bastard among them.\"', '\"I see.\" His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. \"My brother', 'does not seem very festive tonight.\"', 'Page 33', '', 'Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind', 'their eyes. His father was observing', 'all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little,', 'looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking', 'heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast,', 'laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed', 'as cold as an ice sculpture. \"The queen is angry too,\" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \"Father took', 'the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn\\'t want him to go.\"', 'Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \"You don\\'t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man', 'like you on the Wall.\"', 'Jon swelled with pride. \"Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I\\'m the better sword, and Hullen says I', 'sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\"', '\"Notable achievements.\"', '\"Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\" Jon said in a sudden rush. \"Father will give me leave', 'to go if you ask him, I know he will.\"', 'Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \"The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.\"', '\"I am almost a man grown,\" Jon protested. \"I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin', 'says bastards grow up faster than other children.\"', '\"That\\'s true enough,\" Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon\\'s cup from the table,', 'filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.', '\"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\" Jon said. The Young Dragon was', 'one of his heroes.', '\"A conquest that lasted a summer,\" his uncle pointed out. \"Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking', 'the place, and another fifty trying to hold it.

Or have you forgotten that part?\"', '\"I forget nothing,\" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make', 'himself seem taller. \"I want to serve in the Night\\'s Watch, Uncle.\"', 'He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would', 'someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon', \"would be Robb's bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the\", 'heirs of other great houses', 'and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?', '\"You don\\'t know what you\\'re asking, Jon. The Night\\'s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no', 'families. None of us will ever father sons.

Our mistress is honor.\"', '\"A bastard can have honor too,\" Jon said. \"I am ready to swear your oath.\"', 'Page 34', '', '\"You are a boy of fourteen,\" Benjen said. \"Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you', 'cannot understand what you would be giving up.\"', '\"I don\\'t care about that!\" Jon said hotly.', '\"You might, if you knew what it meant,\" Benjen said. \"If you knew what the oath would cost you, you', 'might be less eager to pay the price, son.\"', 'Jon felt anger rise inside him. \"I\\'m not your son!\"', 'Benjen Stark stood up. \"More\\'s the pity.\" He put a hand on Jon\\'s shoulder. \"Come back to me after', 'you\\'ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\\'ll see how you feel.\"', 'Jon trembled. \"I will never father a bastard,\" he said carefully. \"Never!\" He spat it out like venom.', 'Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears', 'begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet.', '\"I must be excused,\" he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him', 'cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to', 'leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor.', 'Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He', 'wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the', 'night.', 'The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak', 'pulled tight around him against the cold.

Why aren\\'t you at the feast?\"', '\"Too hot, too noisy, and I\\'d drunk too much wine,\" the dwarf told him. \"I learned long ago that it is', 'considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?\"', 'Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?\"', '\"Oh, bleed that,\" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then', 'Page 35', '', 'watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted', 'backward onto his legs.', 'Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.', 'The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \"I believe I\\'ve frightened your wolf.

That\\'s it.\"', \"The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon's face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and\", 'when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \"Shy, isn\\'t he?\"', 'Lannister observed.', '\"Sit, Ghost,\" Jon commanded. \"That\\'s it. Keep still.\" He looked up at the dwarf. \"You can touch him', 'now. He won\\'t move until I tell him to. I\\'ve been training him.\"', '\"I see,\" Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost\\'s ears and said, \"Nice wolf.\"', '\"If I wasn\\'t here, he\\'d tear out your throat,\" Jon said. It wasn\\'t actually true yet, but it would be.', '\"In that case, you had best stay close,\" the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and', 'looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. \"I am Tyrion Lannister.\"', '\"I know,\" Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange.', '\"You\\'re Ned Stark\\'s bastard, aren\\'t you?\"', 'Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.', '\"Did I offend you?\" Lannister said. \"Sorry. Dwarfs don\\'t have to be tactful.

She cannot know what she is saying.\"', '\"She knows,\" Catelyn said. \"Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly', 'hidden.

You', 'Page 40', '', 'must be Robert\\'s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\"', 'She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \"The only truths I know are here.', 'The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\"', 'Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \"The Hand of the King', \"has great power, my lord.

Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\"', \"Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn's heart went out to him, but she knew she\", 'could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children\\'s sake. \"You say', 'you love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\"', '\"The Others take both of you,\" Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the', 'window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent', 'farewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full', 'of melancholy, and moisture glittered', 'faintly in the corners of his eyes. \"My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He', 'never came home again.\"', '\"A different time,\" Maester Luwin said. \"A different king.\"', '\"Yes,\" Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \"Catelyn, you shall stay here in', 'Winterfell.\"', 'His words were like an icy draft through her heart. \"No,\" she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her', 'punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?', '\"Yes,\" Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \"You must govern the north in my stead, while', \"I run Robert's errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he\", 'will be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your', 'councils. He must be ready when his time comes.\"', '\"Gods will, not for many years,\" Maester Luwin murmured.', '\"Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and', 'small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\"', 'Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the', 'question whose answer she most dreaded. \"What of the other children?\"', 'Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \"Rickon is very young,\" he said', 'gently. \"He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\"', '\"I could not bear it,\" Catelyn said, trembling.', '\"You must,\" he said. \"Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to', 'suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years', 'she will be of an age to marry too.\"', 'Page 41', '', 'Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed', 'refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \"Yes,\" she said, \"but', 'please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\"', '\"I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\" Ned said. \"Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad', 'feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a', 'sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their', 'friend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\"', 'He was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of', 'them, then: Ned, and both girls, and', 'her sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already.', 'Winterfell was such a vast place. \"Keep him off the walls, then,\" she said bravely. \"You know how Bran', 'loves to climb.\"', 'Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \"Thank you, my lady,\" he whispered. \"This is', 'hard, I know.\"', '\"What of Jon Snow, my lord?\" Maester Luwin asked.', 'Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.', 'Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her,', 'in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on', \"campaign. He had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south\", \"while she remained safe in her father's castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at\", 'her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find', \"between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child's needs.\", 'He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and', 'called him \"son\" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell,', 'Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.', 'That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets,', \"and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They\", \"whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's\", 'Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward', \"Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called\", 'Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet', 'eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked', 'her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.', 'That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \"Never ask me about Jon,\" he', 'said, cold as ice. \"He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you', 'heard that name, my lady.\" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering', \"had stopped, and Ashara Dayne's name was never heard in Winterfell again.\", \"Whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would\", 'persuade him to send the boy away. It', 'Page 42', '', 'was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but', \"she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake,\", 'so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned', 'than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \"Jon must go,\" she said now.', '\"He and Robb are close,\" Ned said. \"I had hoped . . .\"', '\"He cannot stay here,\" Catelyn said, cutting him off. \"He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\" It', 'was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at', 'Winterfell.', 'The look Ned gave her was anguished. \"You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for', 'him at court. A boy with a bastard\\'s name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\"', 'Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\\'s eyes. \"They say your friend Robert', 'has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\"', '\"And none of them has ever been seen at court!\" Ned blazed. \"The Lann.ister woman has seen to that.', 'How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He-\"', 'His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \"Another solution', 'presents itself,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It', 'seems the boy aspires to take the black.\"', 'Ned looked shocked. \"He asked to join the Night\\'s Watch?\"', 'Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet', 'gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a', 'Sworn Brother.

He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn's own\", 'grandchildren for Winterfell.', 'Maester Luwin said, \"There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\"', '\"And even a bastard may rise high in the Night\\'s Watch,\" Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled.', '\"Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of', 'fourteen . . .\"', '\"A hard sacrifice,\" Maester Luwin agreed. \"Yet these are hard times, my lord.

Finally he', 'sighed, and turned back. \"Very well,\" he said to Maester Luwin. \"I suppose it is for the best. I will speak', 'to Ben.\"', '\"When shall we tell Jon?\" the maester asked.', '\"When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart.

Everyone said so. \"Sansa\\'s work is as pretty as she is,\" Septa', 'Mordane told their lady mother once. \"She has such fine, delicate hands.\" When Lady Catelyn had asked', 'about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \"Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\"', 'Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but', 'the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and', 'admiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts,', \"as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella's stitches\", 'looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing.', 'She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the', 'needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel,', \"Ser Rodrik's little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was\", 'leaning over to whisper something in her ear.', '\"What are you talking about?\" Arya asked suddenly.', 'Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.', '\"Tell me,\" Arya said.', 'Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then,', 'and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies.', '\"We were talking about the prince,\" Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss.', 'Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him', 'at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally.', '\"Joffrey likes your sister,\" Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the', 'daughter of Winterfell\\'s steward and Sansa\\'s dearest friend. \"He told her she was very beautiful.\"', '\"He\\'s going to marry her,\" little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \"Then Sansa will be queen of all the', 'realm.\"', 'Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull', 'resentment. \"Beth, you shouldn\\'t make up stories,\" Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her', 'hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \"What did you think of Prince Joff,', 'sister? He\\'s very gallant, don\\'t you think?\"', '\"Jon says he looks like a girl,\" Arya said.', 'Page 44', '', 'Sansa sighed as she stitched. \"Poor Jon,\" she said. \"He gets jealous because he\\'s a bastard.\"', '\"He\\'s our brother,\" Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower', 'room.', 'Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for', 'frowning. It was frowning now. \"What are you talking about, children?\"', '\"Our half brother,\" Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. \"Arya and I were', 'remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\" she said.', 'Septa Mordane nodded. \"Indeed. A great honor for us all.\" Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the', 'compliment. \"Arya, why aren\\'t you at work?\" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts', 'rustling as she started across the room. \"Let me see your stitches.\"', 'Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\\'s attention. \"Here,\" she said,', 'surrendering up her work.', 'The septa examined the fabric. \"Arya, Arya, Arya,\" she said. \"This will not do. This will not do at all.\"', \"Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister's disgrace,\", 'but Jeyne was smirking on her', 'behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself', 'out of her chair and bolted for the door.', 'Septa Mordane called after her. \"Arya, come back here! Don\\'t you take another step! Your lady mother', 'will hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You\\'ll shame us all!\"', 'Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now.', 'She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \"By your leave, my lady.\"', 'Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane', 'was not. \"Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\" the septa demanded.', 'Arya glared at her. \"I have to go shoe a horse,\" she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock', \"on the septa's face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would\", 'take her.', \"It wasn't fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born,\", 'there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote', 'poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa', \"had gotten their mother's fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after\", 'their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call', 'her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better', 'than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a', 'head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.', 'Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon', 'as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went', 'everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden', 'Page 45', '', 'it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about', 'her stitches then.', 'Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the', 'sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne,', 'who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had', 'named her pup \"Lady.\" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she', 'giggled.', 'By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room,', 'they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in', 'the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \"Come,\" she whispered to', 'Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.', 'There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a', 'view of the whole yard. That was where they headed.', 'They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.', 'He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf', 'moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates,', 'smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.', 'Jon gave her a curious look. \"Shouldn\\'t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\"', 'Arya made a face at him. \"I wanted to see them fight.\"', 'He smiled. \"Come here, then.\"', 'Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard', 'below.', 'To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as', 'though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed', 'positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords', 'under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with', 'magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement,', \"Robb's voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet\", 'emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the', 'combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile.', '\"A shade more exhausting than needlework,\" Jon observed.', '\"A shade more fun than needlework,\" Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up', \"her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father's face, as she did. They were the\", 'only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and', 'fire in their hair.

I\\'m nine.\"', 'Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \"You\\'re too skinny,\" he said. He took her', 'arm to feel her muscle.

The wolfling was smarter than any of the', \"hounds in his father's kennel and Bran would\", 'have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing', 'sticks.', 'He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa', 'had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon', \"called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon's wolf, the white\", \"one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn't white. He had tried\", 'a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.', \"Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn't been up to the broken tower\", 'for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.', 'He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew.', 'The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked', 'like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \"You stay here,\" he told him at the base of the sentinel', 'tree near the armory wall. \"Lie down. That\\'s right. Now stay-\"', 'The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a', 'low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the', 'wolf got to his feet and began to howl.', 'Page 50', '', 'Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill', 'went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. \"Quiet,\" he yelled. \"Sit down.', 'Stay. You\\'re worse than Mother.\" The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped', 'off onto the armory roof and out of sight.', \"The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran's second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before\", 'he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when', 'he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.', 'To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels', 'spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you', \"couldn't even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some\", 'monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and', 'twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.', 'When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a', 'glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all', 'the', 'life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles', 'that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the', 'cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the', 'silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of', 'the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.', \"It taught him Winterfell's secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and\", 'valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the', 'bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get', 'inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a', 'narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of', \"wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn't know that, Bran was convinced.\", 'His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he', \"wouldn't, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He\", 'had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone', 'out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.', 'He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to', 'cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his', 'disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the', 'upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.', 'As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. \"You\\'re not my son,\" he told Bran when they', 'fetched him down, \"you\\'re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your', 'mother see you.\"', 'Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really footed her. Since his father would not forbid it,', 'she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was', 'struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not', \"impressed. There were crows' nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and\", 'Page 51', '', 'sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his', 'hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.', 'Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in', \"Bran's clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran\", 'if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, \"I\\'m not made of', 'clay. And anyhow, I never fall.\"', 'Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him', 'down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always', 'won. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never', 'saw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost', 'like being invisible.', 'He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the', 'small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him', 'feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward.', 'He liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the', 'crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient', 'owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.', 'Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a', \"way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran's secret place.\", 'His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long', 'time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top', 'third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father', 'sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen', 'stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now', 'except for Bran and the crows.', 'He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones', 'were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full', 'weight on them.', 'The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and', \"the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn't hear you overhead. That brought\", 'you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was', 'taller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing.', 'You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly', 'over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From', 'there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it', 'leaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet,', \"and then the crows would come round to see if you'd brought any corn.\", 'Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He', 'was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life.', '\"I do not like it,\" a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was', 'Page 52', '', 'drifting out of the last window on this side. \"You should be the Hand.\"', '\"Gods forbid,\" a man\\'s voice replied lazily. \"It\\'s not an honor I\\'d want. There\\'s far too much work', 'involved.\"', 'Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by.', '\"Don\\'t you see the danger this puts us in?\" the woman said. \"Robert loves the man like a brother.\"', '\"Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone', 'indigestion.\"', '\"Don\\'t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will', 'listen to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would', 'refuse him.\"', '\"We ought to count ourselves fortunate,\" the man said. \"The king might as easily have named one of his', 'brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and', 'I\\'ll sleep more easily by night.\"', 'They were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet . . . but they', 'would see him if he swung out in front of the window.', '\"We will have to watch him carefully,\" the woman said.', '\"I would sooner watch you,\" the man said. He sounded bored. \"Come back here.\"', '\"Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck,\" the woman', 'said. \"Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?\"', '\"A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get', 'away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.\"', '\"His wife is Lady Arryn\\'s sister. It\\'s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.\"', 'Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to', 'lower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach.', '\"You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.\"', '\"That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn\\'s bed.\"', '\"If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King\\'s Landing.\"', '\"When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She', \"knew the boy's life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder now that he's safe atop the\", 'Eyrie.\"', '\"Mothers.\" The man made the word sound like a curse. \"I think birthing does something to your minds.', 'You are all mad.\" He laughed. It was a bitter sound. \"Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes.', 'Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.\" He paused a moment. \"Or', 'Page 53', '', 'does she?\"', '\"Do you think the king will require proof?\" the woman said. \"I tell you, he loves me not.\"', '\"And whose fault is that, sweet sister?\"', 'Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as', 'he fell past, pull himself up . . . except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not', 'sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears.', '\"You are as blind as Robert,\" the woman was saying.', '\"If you mean I see the same thing, yes,\" the man said. \"I see a man who would sooner die than betray his', 'king.\"', '\"He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?\" the woman said. \"Oh, I don\\'t deny he\\'s loyal to', \"Robert, that's obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that\", \"comes to pass, the safer we'll all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside\", \"him will only make him worse. He's still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old.\", 'How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?\"', 'Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to', 'find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who', 'was talking.', 'The man sighed. \"You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.\"', '\"Stop that!\" the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man\\'s laughter.', 'Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was the easy way. He', 'moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking.', '\"All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,\" the man said. \"Come here and be quiet.\"', 'Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. He', 'hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange', 'upside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow.', 'Bran looked in the window.', 'Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who', \"they were. The man's back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her\", 'up against a wall.', 'There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened,', 'his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting', 'her there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. \"Stop it,\" she said, \"stop it, stop it. Oh,', 'please . . .\" But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried', 'themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.', 'Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung', 'Page 54', '', 'from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen.', 'He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. She screamed.', \"Everything happened at once then. ' The woman pushed the man\", 'away wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up,', 'bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He *as in too much of', 'a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his', 'panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an', 'instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He', 'shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his', 'other hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the', 'breath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting.', 'Faces appeared in the window above him.', 'The queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a', 'mirror.', '\"He saw us,\" the woman said shrilly.', '\"So he did,\" the man said.', \"Bran's fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into unyielding\", 'stone. The man reached down. \"Take my hand,\" he said. \"Before you fall.\"', 'Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to the ledge. \"What', 'are you doing?\" the woman demanded.', 'The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. \"How old are you, boy?\"', '\"Seven,\" Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man\\'s forearm. He let go', 'sheepishly.', 'The man looked over at the woman. \"The things I do for love,\" he said with loathing. He gave Bran a', 'shove.', 'Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The', 'courtyard rushed up to meet him.', 'Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn.', 'Page 55', '', 'TYRION', 'Somewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a', 'flag of mourning.', 'Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm.', 'Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark', 'forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.', 'When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading,', 'a hundredyear-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn', 'with the back of his hand. His reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked', 'through the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not', 'much a one for sleeping.', 'His legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and', 'limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in', 'front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. \"Chayle,\" he', 'said softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its', 'silver chain. \"I\\'m off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the', \"Valyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon's Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is\", 'the only complete copy I\\'ve ever seen.\" Chayle gaped at him, still halfasleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated', 'his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks.', 'Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep', 'stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were', 'cut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of', \"Winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane's rasping voice drifted\", 'up to him. \"The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.\"', 'Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them.', '\"At least he dies quietly,\" the prince replied. \"It\\'s the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last', 'night.\"', 'Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his', 'head. \"I could silence the creature, if it please you,\" he said through his open visor. His boy placed a', 'longsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard', 'rang to the clangor of steel on steel.', 'The notion seemed to delight the prince. \"Send a dog to kill a dog!\" he exclaimed. \"Winterfell is so', 'infested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one.\"', 'Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. \"I beg to differ, nephew,\" he said. \"The Starks can count', 'past six. Unlike some princes I might name.\"', 'Joffrey had the grace at least to blush.', 'Page 56', '', '\"A voice from nowhere,\" Sandor said.

Do you understand? Do you?\"', 'The boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he turned and', 'fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run.', 'A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff. His soot-dark', 'armor seemed to blot out the sun.

Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya', 'seemed to prefer his company to hers.', 'Sansa was running out of patience now. \"You have to come with me,\" she told her sister firmly. \"You', 'can\\'t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you.\"', 'Arya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted.', '\"Come back here!\"', '\"There\\'s going to be lemon cakes and tea,\" Sansa went on, all adult and reasonable. Lady brushed', 'against her leg.

Nymeria watched her approach warily.', '\"A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,\" Sansa said. \"And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you', 'know that.\"', '\"Myrcella is a little baby.\" Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the', 'brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off.

Why couldn't Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like\", 'Princess Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that.', 'Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different. It', 'would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brother Jon. She even looked like Jon,', 'with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her', \"coloring. And Jon's mother had been common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler,\", \"Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn't been some mistake.

A crowd had gathered around the', \"queen's wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees.

When he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an', 'old man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and', 'graceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard.', 'His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green. He was the', 'handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to', 'his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled', 'under one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold.', 'At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did not kneel with the others. He stood to one side,', 'beside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked', 'and beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of', \"hair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman's. His armor\", 'was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard', 'use. Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a', 'two-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side.', '\"The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,\" the queen was', 'saying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man. He', 'seemed to feel the weight of her gaze. Slowly he turned his head. Lady growled. A terror as', 'overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. She stepped backward and', 'bumped into someone.', 'Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when', 'she turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible', 'mockery of a smile. \"You are shaking, girl,\" he said, his voice rasping. \"Do I frighten you so much?\"', 'He did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face, though it seemed', 'to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the', 'Hound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to', 'wrap her arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on her,', 'and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter.', '\"A wolf,\" a man said, and someone else said, \"Seven hells, that\\'s a direwolf,\" and the first man said,', '\"What\\'s it doing in camp?\" and the Hound\\'s rasping voice replied, \"The Starks use them for wet nurses,\"', 'and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on', 'her and Lady, swords in their hands, and then she was frightened again, and ashamed. Tears filled her', 'eyes.', 'Page 95', '', 'She heard the queen say, \"Joffrey, go to her.\"', 'And her prince was there.', '\"Leave her alone,\" Joffrey said. He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, his golden', 'curls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave her his hand, drew her to her feet. \"What is it, sweet lady?', 'Why are you afraid? No one will hurt you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet,', 'that\\'s all.\" He looked at Sandor Clegane. \"And you, dog, away with you, you\\'re scaring my betrothed.\"', 'The Hound, ever faithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press. Sansa struggled to steady', 'herself. She felt like such a fool. She was a Stark of Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be', 'a queen. \"It was not him, my sweet prince,\" she tried to explain. \"It was the other one.\"', 'The two stranger knights exchanged a look. \"Payne?\" chuckled the young man in the green armor.', 'The older man in white spoke to Sansa gently. \"Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady. He', 'has a fearsome aspect.\"', '\"As well he should.\" The queen had descended from the wheelhouse. The spectators parted to make', 'way for her. \"If the wicked do not fear the Mng\\'s Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.\"', 'Sansa finally found her words. \"Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,\" she said, and a', 'gale of laughter erupted all around her.', '\"Well spoken, child,\" said the old man in white. \"As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark. I am honored', 'to know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting. I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the', 'Kingsguard.\" He bowed.', 'Sansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came', 'back to her. \"The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,\" she said, \"and councillor to Robert our king and', 'to Aerys Targaryen before him. The honor is mine, good knight. Even in the far north, the singers praise', 'the deeds of Barristan the Bold.\"', 'The green knight laughed again. \"Barristan the Old, you mean. Don\\'t flatter him too sweetly, child, he', 'thinks overmuch of himself already.\" He smiled at her. \"Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as', 'well, then I must concede that you are truly our Hand\\'s daughter.\"', 'Joffrey stiffened beside her. \"Have a care how you address my betrothed.\"', 'can answer,\" Sansa said quickly, to quell her prince\\'s anger. She smiled at the green knight. \"Your', 'helmet bears golden antlers, my lord. The stag is the sigil of the royal House. King Robert has two', \"brothers.

The tension of a few moments ago was gone,', 'and Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable . . . until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside, and', 'Page 96', '', 'stood before her, unsmiling. He did not say a word. Lady bared her teeth and began to growl, a low', 'rumble full of menace, but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. \"I am sorry if I', 'offended you, Ser Ilyn,\" she said.', 'She waited for an answer, but none came. As the headsman looked at her, his pale colorless eyes', 'seemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, leaving her soul naked before him.

Why will', 'he not speak to me?\"', '\"Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,\" Lord Renly commented with a sly', 'smile.', 'Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa\\'s hands in his own. \"Aerys Targaryen had', 'his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\"', '\"He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,\" the queen said, \"and his devotion to our realm is', 'unquestioned.\" Then she smiled graciously and said, \"Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak', 'together until the king returns with your father.

Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our', 'guest today.\"', '\"It would be my pleasure, Mother,\" Joffrey said very formally. He took her by the arm and led her away', \"from the wheelhouse, and Sansa's spirits took flight. A whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey\", 'worshipfully. He was so gallant, she thought. The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound,', 'why, it was almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa', \"from the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys's honor against evil Ser\", \"Morgil's slanders.\", 'The touch of Joffrey\\'s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. \"What would you like to do?\"', 'Be with you, Sansa thought, but she said, \"Whatever you\\'d like to do, my prince.\"', 'Jofftey reflected a moment. \"We could go riding.\"', '\"Oh, I love riding,\" Sansa said.', 'Joffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at their heels. \"Your wolf is liable to frighten the', 'horses, and my dog seems to frighten you.

The city walls', 'rose in the distance, high and strong.', 'A hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. Deepwater fishing boats', 'and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading', \"galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys. Catelyn sp~ied the queen's ornate barge, tied\", 'Page 111', '', 'up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean', 'golden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water.', \"And above it all, frowning down from Aegon's high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge drum-towers\", 'crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and', \"dungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers' nests, all fashioned of pale red stone.\", 'Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed.', 'Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on', 'it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he', 'vowed.', 'Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed', 'dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon.', 'A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with', 'wind. The Stonn Dancer moved past it, pulling steadily for shore.', '\"My lady,\" Ser Rodrik said, \"I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not', 'enter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.\"', 'She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian', 'of the Free Cities. \"You would be as much at risk as I would.\"', 'Ser Rodrik smiled. \"I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized', 'myself. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe', 'I am safe enough, my lady.\"', 'Moreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the', 'river, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the', 'hull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up,', 'all smiles. \"King\\'s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer', 'passage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?\"', '\"We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable', 'and not too far from the river.\"', 'The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. \"Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit', 'your needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed', 'upon. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.\"', '\"For the oarmen,\" Catelyn reminded him.', '\"Oh, of a certainty,\" said Moreo. \"Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh.', 'For the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away', 'or spend it all for a night\\'s pleasure.\"', '\"There are worse things to spend money on,\" Ser Rodrik put in. \"Winter is coming.\"', 'Page 112', '', '\"A man must make his own choices,\" Catelyn said. \"They earned the silver. How they spend it is no', 'concern of mine.\"', '\"As you say, my lady,\" Moreo replied, bowing and smiling.', 'Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who', \"carried their chests halfway up Visenya's hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old\", 'place on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them', 'over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large', 'and airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms.', 'Best of all, she had no interest in their names.', '\"I think it best if you stay away from the common room,\" Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in.', '\"Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.\" He wore ringmail, dagger, and', 'longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head. \"I will be back before nightfall,', 'with Ser Aron,\" he promised. \"Rest now, my lady.\"', 'Catelyn was tired.

The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of', 'feathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep.', 'She woke to a pounding on her door.', \"Catelyn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of King's Landing were red in the light of the\", 'setting sun. She had slept longer than she intended. A fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called', 'out, \"Open, in the name of the king.\"', '\"A moment,\" she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger was on the bedside table.', 'She snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door.', 'The men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. Their', 'leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, \"No need for that, m1ady. We\\'re to escort you to the', 'castle.\"', '\"By whose authority?\" she said.', 'He showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal was a mockingbird, in grey', 'wax. \"Petyr,\" she said. So soon. Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik.

No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have come to her. How . . . ?', 'Then she thought, Moreo. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. She', \"hoped he'd gotten a good price for the information.\", 'They had brought a horse for her.

When they', 'reached the Red Keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle', 'windows were alive with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted', 'her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower.', 'He was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil', 'lamp beside him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her.', '\"Cat,\" he said quietly.', '\"Why have I been brought here in this fashion?\"', 'He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. \"Leave us.\" The men departed. \"You were not', 'mistreated, I trust,\" he said after they had gone. \"I gave firm instructions.\" He noticed her bandages.', '\"Your hands . . .\"', 'Catelyn ignored the implied question. \"I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,\"', 'she said icily. \"As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.\"', '\"I\\'ve angered you, my lady. That was never my intent.\" He looked contrite. The look brought back vivid', 'memories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a', 'gift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a', 'small man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she', 'remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads', 'of silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that', 'fastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver.', '\"How did you know I was in the city?\" she asked him.', '\"Lord Varys knows all,\" Petyr said with a sly smile. \"He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see', 'you alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many years?\"', 'Catelyn ignored his familiarity. There were more important questions. \"So it was the King\\'s Spider who', 'found me.\"', 'Littlefinger winced. \"You don\\'t want to call him that. He\\'s very sensitive. Comes of being an eunuch, I', 'imagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oftimes he knows about it before it', 'happens. He has informants everywhere.

I am master of coin, the king\\'s own councillor. Selmy and Lord Renly rode', 'north to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me.

Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.\" There was a', 'soft knock on the door. \"Enter,\" Littlefinger called out.', 'The man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. He', 'wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers', 'of soft velvet. \"Lady Stark,\" he said, taking her hand in both of his, \"to see you again after so many years', 'is such a joy.\" His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. \"Oh, your poor hands.

Our good Maester Pycelle makes a', 'marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?\"', 'Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. \"I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already', 'seen to my hurts.\"', 'Varys bobbed his head. \"I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him so young. The gods are', 'cruel.\"', '\"On that we agree, Lord Varys,\" she said. The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member;', 'Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers.', 'The eunuch spread his soft hands. \"On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I have great esteem for your', 'husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.\"', '\"Yes,\" she was forced to say. \"For a certainty.\"', '\"Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,\" quipped Littlefinger. He smiled slyly. \"At least in', 'Lord Varys\\'s hearing.\"', '\"Good lady,\" Varys said with great solicitude. \"There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing', 'Page 115', '', 'powers. Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.\"', '\"Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,\" she told him. She would not speak of Bran, not', 'here, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger only a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let', 'them see her grief. \"Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.\"', 'Varys giggled like a little girl. \"Oh, yes. I suppose I am guilty. I hope you forgive me, kind lady.\" He', 'eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. \"I wonder if we might trouble you to show us', 'the dagger?\"', 'Catelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an', 'enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unless \"What have you done to Ser', 'Rodrik?\" she demanded.', 'Littlefinger was lost. \"I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance. What dagger', 'are we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?\"', '\"Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,\" Varys informed him. \"I assure you, Lady Stark,', 'nothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser', 'Aron Santagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain dagger. About sunset, they left the castle', 'together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the', 'common room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.\"', '\"How could you know all that?\"', '\"The whisperings of little birds,\" Varys said, smiling. \"I know things, sweet lady. That is the nature of my', 'service.\" He shrugged. \"You do have the dagger with you, yes?\"', 'Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him. \"Here.', 'Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.\"', 'Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge. Blood welled, and he let', 'out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table.', '\"Careful,\" Catelyn told him, \"it\\'s sharp.\"', '\"Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,\" Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and', 'looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip.', 'He flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. \"Such sweet balance. You want to find the', 'owner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You should have', 'come to me.\"', '\"And if I had,\" she said, \"what would you have told me?\"', '\"I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King\\'s Landing.\" He grasped the blade', 'between thumb and forefinger,', 'Page 116', '', 'drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It struck', 'the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. \"It\\'s mine.\"', '\"Yours?\" It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell.', '\"Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name day,\" he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from', 'the wood. \"I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.\" Petyr\\'s sheepish grin made him', 'look half a boy again. \"When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime', 'lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife. Her Grace got the', 'emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.\"', '\"Who?\" Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered pain.', '\"The Imp,\" said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. \"Tyrion Lannister.\"', 'JON', 'The courtyard rang to the song of swords.', \"Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon's chest as he pressed the\", 'attack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. When he raised his sword, Jon went', \"underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy's leg and sent him\", \"staggering. Grenn's downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. When he tried a\", 'sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing', 'and sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that', 'brought a cry of pain.', '\"Enough!\" Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.', 'Grenn cradled his hand. \"The bastard broke my wrist.\"', '\"The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand.

It\\'s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.\" Ser Alliser', 'gestured at Jeren and Toad. \"Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.\"', 'Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty morning air felt good on', 'his face. He leaned on his', 'sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.', '\"That is a longsword, not an old man\\'s cane,\" Ser Alliser said sharply. \"Are your legs hurting, Lord', 'Snow?\"', 'Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. The', 'boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into its scabbard.', '\"No,\" he replied.', 'Page 117', '', 'Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. He was a compact man', 'of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx. \"The truth now,\" he', 'commanded.', '\"I\\'m tired,\" Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel', 'his bruises now that the fight was done.', '\"What you are is weak.\"', '\"I won.\"', '\"No. The Aurochs lost.\"', 'One of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser', 'had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The master-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated', 'him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.', '\"That will be all,\" Thorne told them. \"I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. If the Others', 'ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.\"', 'Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were', 'almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most were two or three', 'years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid', 'of being hit. Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy.', \"Halder's blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them,\", 'the more Jon despised them.', 'Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him.', 'Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned', 'in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with', 'him here. In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm.', 'The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun', 'blacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his', 'cloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through', \"the walls like blood through a man's body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the\", 'walls were cold here, and the people colder.', \"No one had told him the Night's Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister.

He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.', 'Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen', 'Stark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights', 'with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given', 'over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.', 'Page 118', '', 'Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a', 'ranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and', 'pleaded to go with him.

You\\'re no ranger, Jon, only a green', 'boy with the smell of summer still on you.\"', 'Stupidly, Jon argued. \"I\\'ll be fifteen on my name day,\" he said. \"Almost a man grown.\"', 'Benjen Stark frowned. \"A boy you are, and a boy you\\'ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a', \"man of the Night's Watch.

One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a', 'bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at', 'that, but he had no smile for his nephew. \"How often must I tell you no, Jon? We\\'ll speak when I return.\"', 'As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion', \"Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind's eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on\", 'the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?', 'Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur.', 'If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small', 'sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were', 'real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.', 'He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival', 'and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join', 'in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him', 'anything but \"my half brother\" since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. And Arya . .', '. he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair', 'and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had . . . yet she could', 'always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and', 'watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.', '\"You broke my wrist, bastard boy.\"', 'Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three', 'of his friends behind him. He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all', 'called him Toad. The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered,', \"rapers taken down in the Fingers. He'd forgotten their names.

The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him,', 'hard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out.', 'Toad stepped close. \"The little lordling has a mouth on him,\" he said. He had pig eyes, small and shiny.', '\"Is that your mommy\\'s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name.

He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed', 'on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.', 'The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at', 'him. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory.', '\"STOP THIS! NOW!\"', 'Jon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them. \"The yard is for fighting,\" the', 'armorer said. \"Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I\\'ll make them my quarrels.

I saw it,\" one of the rapers put in.', '\"He broke my wrist,\" Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.', 'The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. \"A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maestor Aemon', 'will give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your', 'cells. Not you, Snow.

The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad,', 'and he always seemed in need of a shave.

Put a\", \"good edge on your sword, and they'd be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave\", 'them nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?\"', \"Jon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn't he? But the armorer was taking that away\", 'too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. \"They\\'re all older than me,\" he said', 'defensively.', '\"Older and bigger and stronger, that\\'s the truth. I\\'ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight', 'bigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight?\"', '\"Ser Rodrik Cassel,\" Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him.', 'Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon\\'s face. \"Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever', 'had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths', 'and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the', 'alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have', 'clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich', 'enough to own a real sword.\" His look was grim. \"So how do you like the taste of your victories now,', 'Lord Snow?\"', '\"Don\\'t call me that!\" Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed', 'and guilty. \"I never . . . I didn\\'t think . . .\"', '\"Best you start thinking,\" Noye warned him. \"That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed. Now go.\"', 'By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday. The sun had broken through the clouds. He', 'turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight. Even after', 'all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers. Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and', 'scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky . . . but', 'when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up', 'half the sky.', 'The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when', 'they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. \"And beyond a doubt the most useless,\" Tyrion', 'Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from', 'miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing', 'in', 'the far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.', 'When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than', 'Page 122', '', 'a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice. The ancient stronghold of the', 'black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all. Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from', \"the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night's Watch, and to the north\", 'loomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the', 'stronghold it sheltered. His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride', 'abreast. The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like', 'the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.', 'As he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the', \"kingsroad, when he'd seen it for the first time. The Wall was like that. Sometimes he could almost forget\", 'that it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times', 'when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world. It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and', 'when he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy. He could feel the great weight of all that ice', 'pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell', 'with it.', '\"Makes you wonder what lies beyond,\" a familiar voice said.', 'Jon looked around. \"Lannister. I didn\\'t see-I mean, I thought I was alone.\"', 'Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear. \"There\\'s much to be', 'said for taking people unawares. You never know what you might learn.\"', '\"You won\\'t learn anything from me,\" Jon told him. He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey', \"ended. As the queen's own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night's Watch.\", \"The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King's Tower-so-called, though no king had visited it\", \"for a hundred yearsand Lannister dined at Mormont's own table and spent his days riding the Wall and\", 'his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers.', '\"Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.\" The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking', 'stick. \"As I was saying . . . why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to', 'know what\\'s on the other side?\" He cocked his head and looked at', 'Jon with his curious mismatched eyes. \"You do want to know what\\'s on the other side, don\\'t you?\"', '\"It\\'s nothing special,\" Jon said. He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the', \"mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder's wildlings and ward the realm against the\", 'Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted. \"The rangers say it\\'s just woods and', 'mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.\"', '\"And the grumkins and the snarks,\" Tyrion said. \"Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what\\'s that', 'big thing for?\"', '\"Don\\'t call me Lord Snow.\"', 'The dwarf lifted an eyebrow. \"Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can', \"cut you, and you'll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your\", 'own. Then they can\\'t hurt you with it anymore.\" He gestured with his stick. \"Come, walk with me. They\\'ll', 'be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.\"', 'Page 123', '', \"Jon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf's awkward,\", 'waddling steps. The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around', 'them, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten. Once there was a muffled', 'thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them.', '\"I don\\'t see your wolf,\" Lannister said as they walked.', '\"I chain him up in the old stables when we\\'re training. They board all the horses in the east stables now,', 'so no one bothers him. The rest of the time he stays with me. My sleeping cell is in Hardin\\'s Tower.\"', '\"That\\'s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like', 'our noble king Robert after a long night\\'s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.\"', 'Jon shrugged. \"No one cares where you sleep. Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell', 'you want.\" Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants', 'and weapons. Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.', 'Tyrion Lannister\\'s laughter steamed in the cold air. \"I\\'ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more', 'stonemasons, before your tower collapses.\"', 'Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. The Watch had built nineteen', 'great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept', 'shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall', 'ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad. The other keeps, long deserted,', 'were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the', 'dead manned the parapets.', '\"It\\'s better that I\\'m by myself,\" Jon said stubbornly. \"The rest of them are scared of Ghost.\"', '\"Wise boys,\" Lannister said. Then he changed the subject. \"The talk is, your uncle is too long away.\"', \"Jon remembered the wish he'd wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he\", 'looked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in', 'his eyes. \"He said he\\'d be back by my name day,\" he admitted. His name day had come and gone,', 'unremarked, a fortnight past. \"They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to', \"Lord Arryn. Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower. That's all the way up in\", 'the mountains.\"', '\"I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,\" Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the', 'common hall. He grinned and pulled open the door. \"Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.\"', 'Inside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth. Crows nested in the', 'timbers of its lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of', \"black bread from the day's cooks. Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench\", 'nearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices. Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a', 'moment. Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners.', 'Page 124', '', 'Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. \"Barley, onion, carrot,\" he', 'muttered. \"Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn\\'t a meat.\"', '\"It\\'s mutton stew.\" Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl. The', 'smell made his mouth water.', '\"Snow.\"', \"Jon knew Alliser Thorne's voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before. He\", 'turned.', '\"The Lord Commander wants to see you. Now.\"', 'For a moment Jon was too frightened to move. Why would the Lord Commander want to see him?', 'They had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. \"Is it', 'my uncle?\" he blurted. \"Is he returned safe?\"', '\"The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,\" was Ser', 'Alliser\\'s reply. \"And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.\"', 'Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose. \"Stop it, Thorne. You\\'re frightening the boy.\"', '\"Keep out of matters that don\\'t concern you, Lannister. You have no place here.\"', '\"I have a place at court, though,\" the dwarf said, smiling. \"A word in the right ear, and you\\'ll die a sour', 'old man before you get another boy to train. Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him. Is there', 'news of his uncle?\"', '\"No,\" Ser Alliser said. \"This is another matter entirely. A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a', 'message that concerns his brother.\" He corrected himself. \"His half brother.\"', '\"Bran,\" Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. \"Something\\'s happened to Bran.\"', 'Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm. \"Jon,\" he said. \"I am truly sorry.\"', \"Jon scarcely heard him. He brushed off Tyrion's hand and strode across the hall. He was running by the\", \"time he hit the doors. He raced to the Commander's Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. When the\", 'guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time. By the time he burst into the presence of the', 'Lord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting. \"Bran,\" he said. \"What', 'does it say about Bran?\"', \"Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head\", 'and a shaggy grey beard. He had a raven on his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn. \"I am told', 'you can read.\" He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat', 'watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon. \"Com, \" it muttered in a', 'raucous voice. \"Com, com. \"', \"Jon's finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat. He recognized Robb's\", 'Page 125', '', 'hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them. He realized he was crying.

Read the rest of the letter.\"', 'He looked at the words, but they didn\\'t matter. Nothing mattered. Bran was going to live. \"My brother is', 'going to live,\" he told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and', 'whistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, \"Live! Live!\"', 'Jon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb\\'s letter in his hand. \"My brother is going to live,\"', 'he told the guards. They exchanged a look. He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion', 'Lannister just finishing his meal. He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and', 'spun him around in a circle. \"Bran is going to live!\" he whooped. Lannister looked startled. Jon put him', 'down and thrust the paper into his hands. \"Here, read it,\" he said.', 'Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously. Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away. A thick', 'woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand. He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at', 'all. Jon went to him. Grenn edged backward and put up his hands. \"Stay away from me now, you', 'bastard.\"', 'Jon smiled at him. \"I\\'m sorry about your wrist. Robb used the same move on me once, only with a', 'wooden blade. It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse. Look, if you want, I can show you how', 'to defend that.\"', 'Alliser Thorne overheard him. \"Lord Snow wants to take my place now.\" He sneered. \"I\\'d have an', 'easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.\"', '\"I\\'ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,\" Jon said. \"I\\'d love to see Ghost juggle.\"', 'Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked. Silence fell.', 'Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed. Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table. The laughter', 'spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in. The birds stirred in the rafters, and', 'finally even Grenn began to chuckle.', 'Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his', 'sword hand curled into a fist. \"That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,\" he said at last in the acid tones of', 'an enemy.', 'EDDARD', 'Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable.', \"He was still a horse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king's\", 'steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The', 'honor of the Hand\\'s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. \"It will be convenient on the', 'morrow,\" Ned snapped as he dismounted.', 'Page 126', '', 'The steward bowed very low. \"I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.\"', '\"No, damn it,\" Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. \"I will see', 'them. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.\"', '\"Yes, my lord,\" the steward said. \"We have given you Lord Arryn\\'s former chambers in the Tower of', 'the Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there.\"', '\"My thanks,\" Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his', 'household was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called', 'out. \"It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell', 'Jory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring.\" Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal', 'steward. \"My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments.\"', '\"It will be my great pleasure,\" the steward said.', 'And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing,', 'to find four members of the small council waiting for him.', 'The chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner', 'a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls', 'were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the', 'door, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces.', 'The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. \"Lord Stark, I', 'was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light', 'candles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery.\" His hand left powder stains on Ned\\'s sleeve, and he', 'smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave.', '\"Your gods have heard you,\" Ned replied, cool yet polite. \"The prince grows stronger every day.\" He', \"disentangled himself from the eunuch's grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the\", 'screen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight', 'when Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it', 'disconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before', 'him, fresh from his victory on the Trident.', '\"I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,\" Renly said.', '\"And you as well,\" Ned replied. \"You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your', 'brother Robert.\"', '\"A poor copy,\" Renly said with a shrug.', '\"Though much better dressed,\" Littlefinger quipped. \"Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the', 'ladies of the court.\"', 'It was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his', 'Page 127', '', 'doublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald', 'brooch. \"There are worse crimes,\" Renly said with a laugh. \"The wayyou dress, for one.\"', 'Littlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. \"I have', 'hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.\"', '\"She has,\" Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of', 'the comment rankled him. \"I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.\"', 'Renly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen.', '\"Rather too well,\" Littlefinger said. \"I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?\"', '\"Often, and with some heat,\" Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience with this game they', 'played, this dueling with words.', '\"I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,\" Littlefinger said. \"Here in the south, they say you are', 'all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.\"', '\"I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.\" Ned moved to the council table and', 'said, \"Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.\"', 'The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. \"Well enough for a man of', 'my years, my lord,\" he replied, \"yet I do tire easily, I fear.\" Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad', \"bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester's collar was no simple metal choker such as\", 'Luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered', 'him from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold,', 'bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and', 'amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. \"Perhaps we', 'might begin soon,\" the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. \"I fear I shall', 'fall asleep if we wait much longer.\"', '\"As you will.\" The king\\'s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon', 'embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. \"My', 'lords,\" he said formally, \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting.\"', '\"You are the King\\'s Hand,\" Varys said. \"We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.\"', 'As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here,', 'in this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I', 'am surrounded by flatterers andfools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and', 'wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. \"We are but five,\"', 'he pointed out.', '\"Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,\" Varys said, \"and our', 'gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides', 'Page 128', '', 'beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\"', '\"Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,\" Ned suggested.', 'Renly Baratheon laughed aloud. \"If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could', 'be a long sit.\"', '\"Our good King Robert has many cares,\" Varys said. \"He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten', 'his load.\"', '\"What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to', 'tears,\" Lord Renly said, \"so it falls to us to govern the realm. He does send us a command from time to', 'time.\" He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. \"This morning he', 'commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at', 'once. He has an urgent task for us.\"', 'Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned broke the wax with his', \"thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king's urgent command, reading the words with mounting\", \"disbelief. Was there no end to Robert's folly? And to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound.\", '\"Gods be good,\" he swore.', '\"What Lord Eddard means to say,\" Lord Renly announced, \"is that His Grace instructs us to stage a', 'great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.\"', '\"How much?\" asked Littlefinger, mildly.', 'Ned read the answer off the letter. \"Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand', 'to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor', 'of the archery competition.\"', '\"Ninety thousand gold pieces,\" Littlefinger sighed. \"And we must not neglect the other costs. Robert will', 'want a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools', '\"Fools we have in plenty,\" Lord Renly said.', 'Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, \"Will the treasury bear the expense?\"', '\"What treasury is that?\" Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. \"Spare me the foolishness, Maester.', 'You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No', 'doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present,', 'what matter another hundred thousand?\"', 'Ned was stunned. \"Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?\"', '\"The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part', 'of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading', 'cartels. Of late I\\'ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.\"', 'Page 129', '', 'Ned was aghast. \"Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?\"', 'Littlefinger gave a shrug. \"The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.\"', '\"I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,\" Ned said hotly.', 'Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. \"Lord Arryn was a prudent', 'man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.\"', '\"My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,\" Renly Baratheon said, \"and he loathes what he calls', '\\'counting coppers.\\' \"', '\"I will speak with His Grace,\" Ned said. \"This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.\"', '\"Speak to him as you will,\" Lord Renly said, \"we had still best make our plans.\"', '\"Another day,\" Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to', 'remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first', 'among equals. \"Forgive me, my lords,\" he said in a softer tone. \"I am tired. Let us call a halt for today', 'and resume when we are fresher.\" He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them', 'all, and made for the door.', 'Outside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud', 'and horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the', 'Trident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate', 'themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he', 'was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he', \"would still be here too soon for Ned's liking. He had only to look at Sansa's face to feel the rage twisting\", 'inside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told', 'her that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened', \"to her butcher's boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark\", 'dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell.', 'He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what', 'he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him. \"You\\'re going the', 'wrong way, Stark. Come with me.\"', 'Hesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken', 'courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. They', 'were relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and', 'forgotten. \"This is not the way to my chambers,\" Ned said.', '\"Did I say it was? I\\'m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a', 'wall,\" Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife', 'awaits.\"', '\"What game are you playing, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.\"', '\"Oh?\" Littlefinger\\'s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. \"Then it appears someone has managed', 'Page 130', '', 'an astonishing impersonation. For the last time, come. Or don\\'t come, and I\\'ll keep her for myself.\" He', 'hurried down the steps.', 'Ned followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but', 'he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger.', 'At the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured', 'Ned through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river.', '\"We\\'re outside the castle,\" Ned said.', '\"You are a hard man to fool, Stark,\" Littlefinger said with a smirk. \"Was it the sun that gave it away, or', 'the sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never', 'understand.\" With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey.', 'Ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more slowly. The niches were there,', 'as Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where', 'to look for them. The river was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock', 'and tried not to look down any more often than he had to.', \"When at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water's edge, Littlefinger was lazing\", 'against a rock and eating an apple. He was almost down to the core. \"You are growing old and slow,', 'Stark,\" he said, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water.', 'A GAME, OF THRONLS 175', '\"No matter, we ride the rest of the way.\" He had two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted', 'behind him, down the trail and into the city.', 'Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright', 'with lamplight in the gathering dusk. The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated', 'over the water. Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red', 'glass.', 'Ned Stark dismounted in a fury. \"A brothel,\" he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun', 'him around. \"You\\'ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.\"', '\"Your wife is inside,\" Littlefinger said.', 'It was the final insult. \"Brandon was too kind to you,\" Ned said as he slammed the small man back', 'against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard.', '\"My lord, no,\" an urgent voice called out. \"He speaks the truth.\" There were footsteps behind him.', 'Ned spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He was dressed in brown', 'roughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. \"This is no business of yours,\" Ned', 'began; then, suddenly, the recognition came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. \"Ser Rodfik?\"', 'Rodrik Cassel nodded. \"Your lady awaits you upstairs.\"', 'Ned was lost. \"Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger\\'s?\" He sheathed his', 'blade.', 'Page 131', '', '\"Would that it were, Stark,\" Littlefinger said. \"Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a', \"shade less like the King's Hand. It would not do to have you recognized.

No one paid Ned the least bit of attention. Ser Rodrik waited below while', 'Littlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door.', 'Inside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely.', '\"My lady,\" Ned whispered in wonderment.', '\"Oh, very good,\" said Littlefinger, closing the door. \"You recognized her.\"', '\"I feared you\\'d never come, my lord,\" she whispered against his', 'chest. \"Petyr has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince.', 'How are my girls?\"', '\"Both in mourning, and full of anger,\" he told her. \"Cat, I do not understand. What are you doing in', 'King\\'s Landing? What\\'s happened?\" Ned asked his wife. \"Is it Bran? Is he . . .\" Dead was the word that', 'came to his lips, but he could not say it.', '\"It is Bran, but not as you think,\" Catelyn said.', 'Ned was lost. \"Then how? Why are you here, my love? What is this place?\"', '\"Just what it appears,\" Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. \"A brothel. Can you think of', 'a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?\" He smiled. \"As it chances, I own this particular establishment,', 'so arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is', 'here in King\\'s Landing.\"', '\"Why?\" Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the', 'stiffness of the last two fingers on her left. \"You\\'ve been hurt.\" He took her hands in his own, turned them', 'over. \"Gods. Those are deep cuts . . . a gash from a sword or . . . how did this happen, my lady?\"', 'Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. \"This blade was sent to open', 'Bran\\'s throat and spill his life\\'s blood.\"', 'Ned\\'s head jerked up. \"But . . . who . . . why would', 'She put a finger to his lips. \"Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that way. Listen.\"', 'So he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and', 'Littlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand.', \"Bran's wolf had saved the boy's life, he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the\", \"pups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa's, and\", 'Page 132', '', 'for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he', 'done?', 'Painfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. \"The Imp\\'s dagger,\" he', 'repeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the', 'blade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. \"Why should Tyrion Lannister want', 'Bran dead? The boy has never done him harm.\"', '\"Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?\" Littlefinger asked. \"The Imp would never', 'have acted alone.\"', 'Ned rose and paced the length of the room. \"If the queen had a role', 'in this or, gods forbid, the king himself ... no, I will not believe that.\" Yet even as he said the words, he', \"remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert's talk of sending hired knives after the\", \"Targaryen princess.

He could still hear\", 'Sansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once.', '\"Most likely the king did not know,\" Littlefinger said. \"It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is', 'practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.\"', \"Ned had no reply for that. The face of the butcher's boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two,\", 'and afterward the king had said not a word. His head was pounding.', 'Littlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. \"The accusation is treason', 'either way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth.', 'The queen . . . if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps . . .', '\"We have proof,\" Ned said. \"We have the dagger.\"', '\"This?\" Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. \"A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways,', 'my lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with', 'his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?\" He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. \"My counsel is to', 'drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.\"', 'Ned regarded him coldly. \"Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying.', 'He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow.

It is past time the Hand and I returned', 'to the castle, before our absence is noted.\"', 'Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. \"I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr. When', 'your men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have', 'found you more than a friend.

We have need of men of', 'your sort on the Wall.\"', 'Tyrion grinned. \"Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord', 'Mormont.\" As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had', 'arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent.', 'Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. \"Lannister mocks', 'us.\"', '\"Only you, Ser Alliser,\" Tyrion said.

Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.\"', '\"Why?\" asked Tyrion. \"The crabs are here.\"', 'The remark brought more guffaws from the others.

Shall we duel?\" He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne\\'s chest with', \"the tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander's\", 'mouth as he began to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window.', '\"Duel! Duel! Duel!\"', 'Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt.', 'Mormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. \"To the victor goes the spoils,\"', 'he called out. \"I claim Thorne\\'s share of the crabs.\"', 'Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself. \"You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,\"', 'he scolded.', 'Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. \"If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that', 'sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him.

He could only bow his head politely and', 'say, \"You are too kind, Maester Aemon.\"', 'The blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a', 'hundred years so his maester\\'s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. \"I have', 'been called many things, my lord,\" he said, \"but kind is seldom one of them.\" This time Tyrion himself led', 'the laughter.', 'Much later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered', 'Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. \"The', 'kingsroad can be perilous this far north,\" the Lord Commander told him as they drank.', '\"I have Jyck and Morrec,\" Tyrion said, \"and Yoren is riding south again.\"', '\"Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,\" Mormont announced in a tone', 'that brooked no argument. \"Three men should be sufficient.\"', 'Page 136', '', '\"If you insist, my lord,\" Tyrion said. \"You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see', 'his brothers.\"', 'Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard. \"Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not.

You shall have three strong swords, to', 'keep you safe.\"', '\"I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.\" The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but', 'not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him. \"I hope I can repay', 'your kindness.\"', '\"You can,\" Mormont said bluntly. \"Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and', 'your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need', \"here. You have seen for yourself, my lord.

The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack', 'come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.\"', '\"Three and a third,\" Tyrion said with a yawn.', 'Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. \"I sent Benjen', \"Stark to search after Yohn Royce's son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer\", 'grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish', 'to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch.', \"More fool U'\", '\"Fool, \" the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes,', 'ruffling its wings. \"Fool, \" it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the', 'creature. A pity.', 'The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. \"Gared was near as old as I am and longer', 'on the Wall,\" he went on, \"yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled.

Once the Watch spent its summers building, and', 'each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.\"', 'He was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Mormont', 'Page 137', '', 'had spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to have any', 'meaning. \"I promise, the king will hear of your need,\" Tyrion said gravely, \"and I will speak to my father', 'and my brother Jaime as well.\" And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest', 'unsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses,', 'and Jaime would only laugh.', '\"You are a young man, Tyrion,\" Mormont said. \"How many winters have you seen?\"', 'He shrugged. \"Eight, nine. I misremember.\"', '\"And all of them short.\"', '\"As you say, my lord.\" He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel one that the maesters', \"said had lasted near three years, but Tyrion's earliest memories were of spring.\", '\"When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come.

Already', 'the days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in', 'accord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face.\" Mormont reached out and clutched', 'Tyrion tightly by the hand. \"You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming.', 'There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and I', 'have seen darker shapes in my dreams.\"', '\"In your dreams,\" Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink.', 'Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice. \"The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers', 'on the shore.\"', 'This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. \"The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.\"', '\"Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in', 'numbers greater than ever before.

Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his', 'pocket, and that was how Tyrion left him.', 'It was bitter cold outside. Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded', \"to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander's Keep. He set off across the yard\", \"for his own chambers in the King's Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow\", \"crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night's crust, and his breath steamed before him like a\", 'banner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to', 'warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire.', \"Behind the King's Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious.

It', 'would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not imagine why he', \"would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King's Tower was before him, with its promise\", 'of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the', 'Wall.', 'A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge roughhewn beams sunk deep into the ice', 'and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning.', \"The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion's legs were cramping\", 'too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well,', 'clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls.', 'He had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back. Long', 'enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just about decided to forget his', 'sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend.', 'He moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell away beneath', 'him, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the', 'metal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the', \"Lord Commander's tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed.\", 'Then he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, etched in', 'moonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls,', \"courtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole's Town, the little village\", 'half a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where', 'icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was a', 'bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow.', 'Finally a thick voice behind him said, \"Seven hells, it\\'s the dwarf,\" and the cage jerked to a sudden stop', 'and hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking.', '\"Bring him in, damn it.\" There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and', 'then the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the', 'cage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a', 'second held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes', 'showed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. \"And what will you be', 'Page 139', '', 'wanting, this time of night?\" the one by the winch asked.', '\"A last look.\"', 'The men exchanged sour glances. \"Look all you want,\" the other one said. \"Just have a care you don\\'t', 'fall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.\" A small wooden shack stood under the great', 'crane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men', 'opened the door and went back inside. And then he was alone.', 'It was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall', 'was wider than the kingsroad', 'often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked.', 'The brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would', 'melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was', 'bare again and it was time to crush more stone.', 'Still, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall', 'stretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side.', 'West, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest', 'the north edge, where the gravel looked freshest.', 'His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but', 'Tyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the', 'white ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western', 'horizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The', 'throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy,', 'half-embedded in the ice.', 'On the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. \"Who goes there? Halt!\"', 'Tyrion stopped. \"If I halt too long I\\'ll freeze in place, Jon,\" he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward', 'him silently and sniffed at his furs. \"Hello, Ghost.\"', 'Jon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather, the hood of his', 'cloak pulled down over his face. \"Lannister,\" he said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. \"This', 'is the last place I would have expected to see you.\" He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he', 'was, and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn,', 'banded with silver.', '\"This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,\" Tyrion admitted. \"I was captured by a whim. If', 'I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?\"', '\"Not with me here,\" Jon promised.', 'Tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears. The red eyes watched him impassively. The beast came', \"up as high as his chest now.

Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out', 'in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow', 'her whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and', 'blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt', 'strong and new and fierce.', 'And the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as if the gods had heard her', 'and taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. \"Khaleesi, \" Jhiqui said, \"what is wrong? Are you', 'sick?\"', '\"I was,\" she answered, standing over the dragon\\'s eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed. She', 'Page 151', '', 'touched one, the largest of the three, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and-scarlet, she', 'thought, like the dragon in my dream. The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers . . . or was she', 'still dreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously.', 'From that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before it. Her legs grew stronger; her blisters', 'burst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather.', 'The khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the Dothraki fashion, but it was the', 'filly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to know her moods, as if they shared a single mind.', 'With every passing day, Dany felt surer in her seat. The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people,', 'and it was not their custom to name', 'their animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved anything so much.', 'As the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her. She rode', 'at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and', 'unspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of', 'choking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant.', 'They crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk', 'watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that', 'was swift and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a high blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of', 'a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down', 'Valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. For half a moon, they rode', 'through the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of', 'the trees were as wide as city gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and lemurs', 'with silver fur and huge purple eyes, but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and Dany got no', 'glimpse of them.', \"By then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day's riding, yet somehow the pain\", 'had a sweetness to it now, and each morning she came willingly to her saddle, eager to know what', 'wonders waited for her in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still', 'cried out when Drogo took her, it was not always in pain.', 'At the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a trot and rode', 'out onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the khalasar she was never alone. Khal', 'Drogo came to her only after the sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by', \"the door of her tent, Drogo's bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far, and her brother was an\", 'unwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear him on the top of the ridge, his voice shrill with', 'anger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea.', 'The green swallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed with the smell of', \"horseflesh and Dany's sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki smells. They seemed to belong here. Dany\", 'breathed it all in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that', 'thick black soil. Swinging', 'down from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots.', 'Page 152', '', 'Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too', 'hard. \"You dare!\" he screamed at her. \"You give commands to me? To me?\" He vaulted off the horse,', 'stumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her.', '\"Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you. Look at you!\"', 'Dany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a', 'painted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and', 'stained in city silks and ringmail.', 'He was still screaming. \"You do not command the dragon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the', 'Seven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord\\'s slut, do you hear me?\" His hand went', 'under her vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. \"Do you hear me?\"', 'Dany shoved him away, hard.', 'Viserys stared at her, his lilac eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. Never fought back. Rage', 'twisted his features. He would hurt her now, and badly, she knew that.', 'Crack.', 'The whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him', 'backward. He went sprawling in the grass, stunned and choking. The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he', 'struggled to free himself. The one with the whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not', 'understand his words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. \"Jhogo asks if', 'you would have him dead, Khaleesi, \" Irri said.', '\"No,\" Dany replied. \"No.\"', 'Jhogo understood that. One of the others barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed. Irri told her,', '\"Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.\"', 'Her brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling', 'for breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe.', '\"Tell them I do not wish him harmed,\" Dany said.', 'Irri repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a', 'puppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under', 'his chin where the whip had cut deep.', '\"I warned him what would happen, my lady,\" Ser Jorah Mormont said. \"I told him to stay on the ridge,', 'as you commanded.\"', '\"I know you did,\" Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, sucking in air noisily, red-faced', 'and sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that', 'before? There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been.', '\"Take his horse,\" Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he was', 'Page 153', '', 'hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words came. \"Let my brother walk', 'behind us back to the khalasar.\" Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride was no man at all, the', 'lowest of the low, without honor or pride. \"Let everyone see him as he is.\"', '\"No!\" Viserys screamed. He turned to Ser Jorah, pleading in the Common Tongue with words the', 'horsemen would not understand. \"Hit her, Mormont. Hurt her. Your king commands it. Kill these', 'Dothraki dogs and teach her.\"', 'The exile knight looked from Dany to her brother; she barefoot, with dirt between her toes and oil in her', 'hair, he with his silks and steel. Dany could see the decision on his face. \"He shall walk, Khaleesi,\" he', \"said. He took her brother's horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver.\", 'Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence, but he would not move, and his eyes', 'were full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was lost in the tall grass. When they could not see him', 'anymore, Dany grew afraid. \"Will he find his way back?\" she asked Ser Jorah as they rode.', '\"Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,\" he replied.', '\"He is proud. He may be too shamed to come back.\"', 'Jorah laughed. \"Where else should he go? If he cannot find the khalasar, the khalasar will most surely', 'find him. It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child.\"', 'Dany saw the truth of that. The khalasar was like a city on the march, but it did not march blindly.', 'Always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column, alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies, while', 'outriders guarded their flanks. They missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where they had come', 'from. These plains were a part of them . . . and of her, now.', '\"I hit him,\" she said, wonder in her voice. Now that it was over, it seemed like some strange dream that', 'she had dreamed. \"Ser Jorah, do you think . . . he\\'ll be so angry when he gets back She shivered. \"I', \"woke the dragon, didn't IT'\", 'Ser Jorah snorted. \"Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and he', 'died on the Trident. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.\"', 'His blunt words startled her. It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly', 'called into question. \"You . . . you swore him your sword . . .\"', '\"That I did, girl,\" Ser Jorah said. \"And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make his', 'servants?\" His voice was bitter.', '\"He is still the true king. He is . . .\"', 'Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \"Truth now. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\"', 'Dany thought about that. \"He would not be a very good king, would he?\"', '\"There have been worse . . . but not many.\" The knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again.', 'Page 154', '', 'Dany rode close beside him. \"Still,\" she said, \"the common people are waiting for him.

It went against everything that', 'Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper', \"reigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah's words, the more they rang of truth.\", '\"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?\" she asked him.', '\"Home,\" he said. His voice was thick with longing.', '\"I pray for home too,\" she told him, believing it.', 'Ser Jorah laughed. \"Look around you then, Khaleesi.\"', \"But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King's Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the\", \"Conqueror had built. It was Dragonstone where she had been born. In her mind's eye they burned with a\", \"thousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind's eye, all the doors were red.\", '\"My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\" Dany said. She had known that for a long time,', 'she realized. She had known it all her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a', 'whisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.', 'A GAML OF THRONLS 207', 'Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. \"You think not.\"', '\"He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,\" Dany said. \"He has no coin and the', 'only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness.', 'He will never take us home.\"', '\"Wise child.\" The knight smiled.', '\"I am no child,\" she told him fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount, rousing the silver to', 'a gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind, the warm wind in', 'her hair and the setting sun red on her face. By the time she reached the khalasar, it was dusk.', 'The slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool. She could hear rough voices from the', 'woven grass palace on the hill. Soon there would be laughter, when the men of her khas told the story of', 'what had happened in the grasses today. By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every', 'man, woman, and child in the camp would know him for a walker. There were no secrets in the khalasar.', 'Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent. It was cool and dim beneath', 'the silk. As she let the door flap close behind her, Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch', \"her dragon's eggs across the tent. For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her\", 'eyes. She blinked, and they were gone.', 'Page 155', '', 'Stone, she told herself. They are only stone, even Illyrio said so, the dragons are all dead. She put her', 'palm against the black egg, fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell. The stone was warm.', 'Almost hot. \"The sun,\" Dany whispered. \"The sun warmed them as they rode.\"', 'She commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath. Doreah built a fire outside the tent, while Irri and', 'Jhiqui fetched the big copper tub-another bride gift-from the packhorses and carried water from the', 'pool. When the bath was steaming, Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her.', '\"Have you ever seen a dragon?\" she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her', 'hair.

Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild.', '\"Dragons are gone, Khaleesi,\" Irri said.', '\"Dead,\" agreed Jhiqui. \"Long and long ago.\"', 'Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago,', 'during the reign of Aegon 111, who', 'was called the Dragonbane.

The', 'seat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on', 'the ends of its massive arms. Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless legs dangling. The great seat made', 'him feel half a baby.', 'Robb put a hand on his shoulder. \"You said you had business with Bran. Well, here he is, Lannister.\"', \"Bran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister's eyes.

He never fell, never never never.', '\"The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,\" said Maester Luwin', 'gently.', '\"Curious,\" said Tyrion Lannister.', '\"My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,\" Robb said curtly. \"Do your business and be on', 'your way.\"', 'Page 161', '', '\"I have a gift for you,\" the dwarf said to Bran. \"Do you like to ride, boy?\"', 'Maester Luwin came forward. \"My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs. He cannot sit a horse.\"', '\"Nonsense,\" said Lannister. \"With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride.\"', 'The word was a knife through Bran\\'s heart. He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes. \"I\\'m not a cripple!\"', '\"Then I am not a dwarf,\" the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth. \"My father will rejoice to hear it.\"', 'Greyjoy laughed.', '\"What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?\" Maester Luwin asked.', '\"A smart horse,\" Lannister replied. \"The boy cannot use his legs to', 'command the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the', 'voice. I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be unlearned.\" He drew a rolled', 'paper from his belt. \"Give this to your saddler. He will provide the rest.\"', 'Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand, curious as a small grey squirrel. He unrolled it,', 'studied it. \"I see. You draw nicely, my lord. Yes, this ought to work. I should have thought of this', 'myself.\"', '\"It came easier to me, Maester. It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.\"', '\"Will I truly be able to ride?\" Bran asked. He wanted to believe them, but he was afraid. Perhaps it was', 'just another lie. The crow had promised him that he could fly.', '\"You will,\" the dwarf told him. \"And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of', 'them.\"', 'Robb Stark seemed puzzled. \"Is this some trap, Lannister? What\\'s Bran to you? Why should you want', 'to help him?\"', '\"Your brother Jon asked it of me.

Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in, breathless.', 'The direwolves were with him. The boy stopped by the door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on. Their', 'eyes found Lannister, or perhaps they caught his scent. Summer began to growl first. Grey Wind picked', 'it up. They padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left.', '\"The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,\" Theon Greyioy commented.', '\"Perhaps it\\'s time I took my leave,\" Tyrion said. He took a step backward . . . and Shaggydog came out', 'of the shadows behind him, snarling.

He crept backward, away from', \"the little man, and settled down below Bran's dangling feet.\", 'Robb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and called, \"Grey Wind.\" His direwolf moved', 'to him, swift and silent. Now there was only Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, his eyes burning like', 'green fire.', '\"Rickon, call him,\" Bran shouted to his baby brother, and Rickon remembered himself and screamed,', '\"Home, Shaggy, home now.\" The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon,', 'who hugged him tightly around the neck.', 'Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf, mopped at his brow, and said in a flat voice, \"How interesting.\"', '\"Are you well, my lord?\" asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced nervously at the', 'direwolves as he spoke.', '\"My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity.\"', 'Even Robb looked shaken. \"The wolves . . . I don\\'t know why they did that . . .\"', '\"No doubt they mistook me for dinner.\" Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran. \"I thank you for calling them off,', 'young ser. I promise you, they would have found me quite indigestible. And now I will be leaving, truly.\"', '\"A moment, my lord,\" Maester Luwin said. He moved to Robb and they huddled close together,', 'whispering. Bran tried to hear what they were saying, but their voices were too low.', 'Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword. \"I . . . I may have been hasty with you,\" he said. \"You\\'ve done', 'Bran a kindness, and, well . . .\" Robb composed himself with an effort. \"The hospitality of Winterfell is', 'yours if you wish it, Lannister.\"', '\"Spare me your false courtesies, boy.

You', 'will find me on the road, no doubt.\" With that he made his exit, struggling across the hall on his short legs,', 'past Rickon and out the door.

I hope you will honor us at table\", 'tonight.\" He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned,', 'not words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same.', 'Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed. Old Nan was asleep', 'in her chair. Hodor said \"Hodor,\" gathered up his great-grandmother, and carried her off, snoring softly,', 'while Bran lay thinking. Robb had promised that he could feast with', 'Page 163', '', 'the Night\\'s Watch in the Great Hall. \"Summer,\" he called. The wolf bounded up on the bed. Bran', 'hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek. \"I can ride now,\" he whispered to his', 'friend. \"We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.\" After a time he slept.', 'In his dream he was climbing again, pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower, his fingers forcing', 'themselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed,', 'through the clouds and into the night sky, and still the tower rose before him. When he paused to look', 'down, his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping. Bran cried out and clung for dear life. The', 'earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. He could not fly. He waited until his heart', 'had stopped pounding, until he could breathe, and he began to climb again. There was no way to go but', 'up. Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles.', 'His arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles', 'watched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions,', 'but now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone', 'voices terrible to hear. He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear', 'them he was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the', 'side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all. \"I didn\\'t hear,\" he wept as they', 'came closer and closer, \"I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t.\"', 'He woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him. \"I didn\\'t hear,\" he', 'whispered, trembling in fear, but then the shadow said \"Hodor,\" and lit the candle by the bedside, and', 'Bran sighed with relief.', 'Hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm, damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands.', 'When it was time, he carried him down to the Great Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near', \"the fire. The lord's seat at the head of the table had been left empty, but Robb sat to the right of it, with\", 'Bran across from him. They ate suckling pig that night, and pigeon pie, and turnips soaking in butter, and', \"afterward the cook had promised honeycombs. Summer snatched table scraps from Bran's hand, while\", \"Grey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner. Winterfell's dogs would not come near the\", 'hall now. Bran had found that strange at first, but he was growing used to it.', 'Yoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester', 'Luwin. The old man had a sour', 'smell, as if he had not washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the ribs to', 'suck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. \"Ser Alliser\\'s bane,\" he', 'grunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand. But when Robb asked', 'for news of their uncle Benjen, the black brothers grew ominously quiet.', '\"What is it?\" Bran asked.', 'Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest. \"There\\'s hard news, m\\'lords, and a cruel way to pay you for your', 'meat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer.

He rose from the bench and laid his', 'hand on the hilt of his sword. \"Do you hear me? My uncle is not dead!\" His voice rang against the stone', 'walls, and Bran was suddenly afraid.', 'Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb, unimpressed. \"Whatever you say, m\\'lord,\" he said. He', 'sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth.', 'The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \"There\\'s not a man on the Wall', 'knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark.

For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know', 'what to say. \"We\\'ll find a horse for you, I promise,\" Robb whispered at last.', '\"Are they ever coming back?\" Bran asked him.', '\"Yes,\" Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just', 'Robb the Lord. \"Mother will be home soon.

We won\\'t even tell Jon we\\'re coming, we\\'ll just be', 'there one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.\"', '\"An adventure,\" Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not', \"see the tears on Robb's face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together.\", 'EDDARD', 'Page 165', '', '\"Lord Arryn\\'s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"I would be', 'more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing. Do be seated. Would you care for', 'refreshments? Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer agrees', 'with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most', 'refreshing in this heat.\"', 'There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air', 'covered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their', 'hot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be', 'found. \"That would be most kind,\" Ned said, seating himself.', 'Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently.

Well', 'sweetened.\"', 'As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his', 'hands on his stomach. \"The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest. It is not so,', 'yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.\"', 'The heavy jeweled chain', 'around the old man\\'s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. \"To be sure, King Maekar\\'s summer', 'was hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean', 'that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke', 'suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted.', 'Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night. We would walk in the gardens by', 'the river and argue about the gods. I remember the smells of those nights, my lord-perfume and sweat,', 'melons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom. I was a young man', 'then, still forging my chain. The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.\" Pycelle\\'s eyes were so heavily', 'lidded he looked half-asleep. \"My pardons, Lord Eddard. You did not come to hear foolish meanderings', 'of a summer forgotten before your father was born. Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would.', 'Minds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust. Ah, and here is our milk.\" The serving girl', 'placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. \"Sweet child.\" He lifted a cup, tasted,', 'nodded. \"Thank you. You may go.\"', 'When the girl had taken her leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes. \"Now where were', 'we? Oh, yes. You asked about Lord Arryn . . .\"', '\"I did.\" Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold, but oversweet to his taste.', '\"If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,\" Pycelle said. \"We had sat', 'together on council many a year, he and 1, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the', 'great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all', 'the cares of the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she', 'would scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon', 'was not young. Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I', 'am less certain.\" He gave a ponderous shake of his head.', '\"What can you tell me of his final illness?\"', 'Page 166', '', 'The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. \"He came to me one day asking', 'after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling', 'him deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon', 'thought it was a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which', 'can upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not', 'grant me the power to save him.\"', '\"I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.\"', 'The Grand Maester\\'s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. \"I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will', 'never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a', 'son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do', 'not comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and', 'pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.\"', '\"Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?\"', 'Pycelle wrinkled his brow. \"In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several', 'times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit', 'the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat', \"beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon's spirits.

A man\\'s squire often knew a great deal of his comings and', 'goings.', '\"Ser Hugh of the Vale,\" Littlefinger named him. \"The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn\\'s death.\"', '\"I shall send for him,\" Ned said. \"And the others.\"', 'Littlefinger winced. \"My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.\"', '\"Why?\"', '\"Come, and I\\'ll show you, my lord.\"', 'Frowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture. \"There, across the yard, at', 'the door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?\"', '\"What of him?\"', '\"He reports to Varys. The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings.\" He shifted in the', 'window seat. \"Now glance at the wall. Farther west, above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the', 'ramparts?\"', 'Ned saw the man. \"Another of the eunuch\\'s whisperers?\"', '\"No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better', 'to note who calls on you.', 'There are others, many unknown even to me. The Red Keep is full of eyes. Why do you think I hid Cat', 'in a brothel?\"', 'Eddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues. \"Seven hells,\" he swore. It did seem as though the man on', 'the wahs was watching him. Suddenly uncomfortable, Ned moved away from the window. \"Is everyone', 'someone\\'s informer in this cursed city?\"', '\"Scarcely,\" said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. \"Why, there\\'s me, you, the king . . .', \"although, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and I'm less than certain about\", 'you.\" He stood up. \"Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Ned.', '\"In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,\" Littlefinger said', 'Page 171', '', 'with a mocking smile. \"The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may. Send this paragon of', 'yours to Ser Hugh and the others. Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the', 'Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day.\" He started for the door.', '\"Lord Petyr,\" Ned called after him. \"I . . . am grateful for your help. Perhaps I was wrong to distrust', 'you.\"', 'Littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard. \"You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was', 'the wisest thing you\\'ve done since you climbed down off your horse.\"', 'JON', 'Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice', 'yard. \"Your feet should be farther apart,\" he urged. \"You don\\'t want to lose your balance. That\\'s good.', 'Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.\"', 'Dareon broke off and lifted his visor. \"Seven gods,\" he murmured. \"Would you look at this, Jon.\"', 'Jon turned. Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the', 'door of the armory. By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his', 'embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a', 'face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. \"They . . . they told me I', 'was to come here for . . . for training,\" he said to no one in particular.', '\"A lordling,\" Pyp observed to Jon. \"Southron, most like near Highgarden.\" Pyp had traveled the Seven', \"Kingdoms with a mummers' troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you'd been\", 'born just from the sound of your voice.', \"A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy's fur-trimmed\", 'surcoat. Jon did not recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, \"It', 'would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south.', 'Now they send us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?\"', 'It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled', 'leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding', 'huntsman he wore on his surcoat. As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip', 'himself from the armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail', 'hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to', 'detach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely', 'move. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. \"Let us', 'hope you are not as inept as you look,\" Ser Alliser said. \"Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.\"', 'Jon Snow winced. Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason. He was sixteen,', 'tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt. \"This will be uglier than a whore\\'s', 'ass,\" Pyp muttered, and it was.', 'Page 172', '', 'The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as', 'blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers. \"I yield,\" he shrilled. \"No more, I', 'yield, don\\'t hit me.\" Rast and some of the other boys were laughing.', 'Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. \"On your feet, Ser Piggy,\" he called. \"Pick up your sword.\"', 'When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder. \"Hit him with the flat of your', 'blade until he finds his feet.\" Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe\\'s upraised cheeks. \"You can hit', 'harder than that,\" Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it', 'down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat. The new boy screeched in pain.', 'Jon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. \"Jon, no,\" the small boy whispered', 'with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne.', '\"On your feet,\" Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again. \"Ser Piggy', 'is starting to grasp the notion,\" Ser Alliser observed. \"Again.\"', 'Halder lifted the sword for another blow. \"Cut us off a ham!\" Rast urged, laughing.', 'Jon shook off Pyp\\'s hand. \"Halder, enough.\"', 'Halder looked to Ser Alliser.', '\"The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,\" the master-at-arms', 'said in that sharp, cold voice of his. \"I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.\"', '\"Look at him, Haider,\" Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. \"There\\'s no honor in beating a fallen', 'foe. He yielded.\" He knelt beside the fat boy.', 'Haider lowered his sword. \"He yielded,\" he echoed.', 'Ser Alliser\\'s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. \"It would seem our Bastard is in love,\" he said as Jon', 'helped the fat boy to his feet. \"Show me your steel, Lord Snow.\"', 'Jon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it', 'now.', 'Thorne smiled. \"The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it. Rat,', 'Pimple, help our Stone Head here.\" Rast and Albett moved to join Haider. \"Three of you ought to be', 'sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All you need do is get past the Bastard.\"', '\"Stay behind me,\" Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never', 'three. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He braced himself for the assault.', 'Suddenly Pyp was beside him. \"Three to two will make for better sport,\" the small boy said cheerfully.', 'He dropped his visor and slid out his sword. Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped', 'up to make a third.', 'The yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser\\'s eyes. \"Why are you waiting?\" he asked', 'Page 173', '', 'Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first. Haider barely got', 'his sword up in time.', 'Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your', 'foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Haider, brutally strong but short of patience, with no', 'taste for defense. Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset.', 'The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him. Jon blocked a savage', 'cut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together. He slammed a', \"sidestroke into Haider's ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain. The counterstroke caught\", 'Jon on the shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Haider was', 'unbalanced. Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash.', 'Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was', 'hard-pressed. Rast had two years', '232', 'GEORGE R.R. MARTIN', \"and forty pounds on him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper's helm like a bell. As Rast went\", 'reeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat. By then Jon', 'had moved on. Facing two swords, Albett backed away. \"I yield,\" he shouted.', 'Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. \"The mummer\\'s farce has gone on long enough for', 'today.\" He walked away. The session was at an end.', \"Dareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman's son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the\", 'yard. \"For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.\"', '\"For an instant, you did,\" Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He', 'sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his', 'teeth.', '\"Let me,\" a voice said. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently. \"Did he', 'hurt you?\"', '\"I\\'ve been bruised before.\" He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard was emptying around them.', 'Blood matted the fat boy\\'s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. \"My name is Samwell Tarly, of', 'Horn . . .\" He stopped and licked his lips. \"I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I . . . left.

I couldn\\'t. I didn\\'t want him to hit me anymore.\" He looked at the ground.', '\"I', 'My lord father always said so.\"', 'Grenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything.', 'What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?', 'Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. His eyes', '. if you want, you can call me Sam.', \"I fear I'm a coward.\", 'met Jon\\'s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. \"I ... I\\'m sorry,\" he said. \"I don\\'t mean to . . . to', 'be like I am.\" He walked heavily toward the armory.', 'Jon called after him. \"You were hurt,\" he said. \"Tomorrow you\\'ll do better.\"', 'Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. \"No I won\\'t,\" he said, blinking back tears. \"I never do', 'better.\"', 'When he was gone, Grenn frowned. \"Nobody likes cravens,\" he said uncomfortably. \"I wish we hadn\\'t', 'helped him. What if they think we\\'re craven too?\"', '\"You\\'re too stupid to be craven,\" Pyp told him.', '\"I am not,\" Grenn said.', '\"Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you\\'d be too stupid to run away.\"', '\"I would not,\" Grenn insisted. \"I\\'d run away faster than you.\" He stopped suddenly, scowling when he', \"saw Pyp's grin and realized what he'd just said. His thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there\", 'arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor.', 'Page 175', '', 'Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for', 'work. The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon', 'cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for', \"the Lord Commander's table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the\", 'armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or', 'pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard,', 'mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his', 'counts and inventories.', 'That afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed', 'stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. It was lonely and boring work, even with', 'Ghost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world', 'from the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing. He could think here, and he found', 'himself thinking of Samwell Tarly . . . and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered what Tyrion would', 'have made of the fat boy. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him,', 'grinning. The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to', 'admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.', 'His sore shoulder made the work go slowly. It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the', 'paths. He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning the western sky the color of blood. Finally,', 'as dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the', 'winch men to lower him.', 'The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall. A group of the', 'black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire. His friends were at the bench nearest the west', \"wall, laughing. Pyp was in the middle of a story. The mummer's boy with the big ears was a born liar with\", 'a hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as', 'needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin', 'princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs', \"were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser. Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp's antics as\", 'anyone . . . yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly', 'sat alone, as far from the others as he could get.', 'He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across', 'from him. The fat boy\\'s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost. \"Is that a wolf?\"', '\"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost. The direwolf is the sigil of my father\\'s House.\"', '\"Ours is a striding huntsman,\" Samwell Tarly said.', '\"Do you like to hunt?\"', 'The fat boy shuddered. \"I hate it.\" He looked as though he was going to cry again.', '\"What\\'s wrong now?\" Jon asked him. \"Why are you always so frightened?\"', 'Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk. A', 'burst of laughter filled the hall. Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice. He stood. \"Let\\'s go outside.\"', 'Page 176', '', 'The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. \"Why? What will we do outside?\"', '\"Talk,\" Jon said. \"Have you seen the Wall?\"', '\"I\\'m fat, not blind,\" Samwell Tarly said. \"Of course I saw it, it\\'s seven hundred feet high.\" Yet he stood', 'up all the same, wrapped a furlined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still', 'wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night. Ghost padded along beside', 'them. \"I never thought it would be like this,\" Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the', 'A GAML OF THRONFS 235', 'cold air.

At first I thought it was so beautiful, like', 'feathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of', 'snow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming. I was afraid it would never', 'end.\"', 'Jon smiled.', 'The Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon. In the sky above, the stars', 'burned clear and sharp. \"Are they going to make me go up there?\" Sam asked. His face curdled like old', 'milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs. \"I\\'ll die if I have to climb that.\"', '\"There\\'s a winch,\" Jon said, pointing. \"They can draw you up in a cage.\"', 'Samwell Tarly sniffled. \"I don\\'t like high places.\"', 'It was too much.

Why would a coward want to join the Night's\", 'Watch?\"', 'Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself.

Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick', \"the warm tears off Samwell Tarly's face. The fat boy cried out, startled . . . and somehow, in a heartbeat,\", 'his sobs turned to laughter.', 'Page 177', '', 'Jon Snow laughed with him. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost', 'between them. Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer', 'snows. It seemed a thousand years ago now. Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell.', '\"Sometimes I dream about it,\" he said. \"I\\'m walking down this long empty hall.

Most nights it's my father, but sometimes it's Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my\", 'uncle.\" The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out', 'rangers in search of him.

In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of', 'Ben Stark vanished.', '\"Do you ever find anyone in your dream?\" Sam asked.', 'Jon shook his head. \"No one. The castle is always empty.\" He had never told anyone of the dream, and', 'he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. \"Even the', 'ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run', 'then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone.', \"And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It's black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling\", \"down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don't want to. I'm afraid of what might be\", 'waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their', \"feet and iron swords across their laps, but it's not them I'm afraid of. I scream that I'm not a Stark, that\", \"this isn't my place, but it's no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend,\", 'with no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream.\" He stopped, frowning,', 'embarrassed. \"That\\'s when I always wake.\" His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his', 'cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep', 'with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. \"Do you dream of Horn Hill?\" Jon asked.', '\"No.\" Sam\\'s mouth grew tight and hard. \"I hated it there.\" He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding,', 'and Jon let the silence breathe. After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened', 'quietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall.', 'The Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of', 'the South. The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and', 'a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of', 'Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years.', \"Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell's birth vanished as the boy grew up plump,\", 'soft, and awkward. Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in', 'the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry', 'tarts. His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at the sight of', 'blood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered. A dozen mastersat-arms came and went at Horn', 'Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and', 'starved. One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his', 'Page 178', '', \"mother's clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and\", 'more frightened, until Lord Randyll\\'s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. \"One time,\"', 'Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, \"two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth', 'with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it', 'didn\\'t make me brave as they\\'d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.\"', 'Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son. From that', 'day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to', 'his liking. Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books.', 'Until The dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and', 'ready. Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a', 'deer. \"You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,\" Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his', 'long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke. \"You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither', \"will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon's.

And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once. When he was done, they sat', 'together and listened to the wind for a time. There was no other sound in all the world.', 'Finally Jon said, \"We should go back to the common hall.\"', '\"Why?\" Sam asked.', 'Jon shrugged. \"There\\'s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer. Some nights Dareon sings for us,', 'if the mood is on him. He was a singer, before . . . well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.\"', '\"How did he come here?\" Sam asked.', '\"Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter.

Pyp backed him, as he\\'d known', 'he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon', 'knew the words to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some,', 'shamed the others, made threats where threats were required. At the end they had all agreed . . . all but', 'Rast.', '\"You girls do as you please,\" Rast said, \"but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I\\'m going to slice', 'me off a rasher of bacon.\" He laughed in Jon\\'s face and left them there.', 'Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on', \"his legs. Jon could hear Rast's rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest. The direwolf's eyes burned\", \"red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy's throat, just enough to draw blood.\", '\"Remember, we know where you sleep,\" Jon said softly.', 'The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved.', 'From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly.

It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in', \"time he was laughing at Pyp's faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them.\", 'Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool.

As ever, Robert had not troubled himself to attend the', 'council session, so it fell to his Hand to speak for him.', '\"As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.\"', '\"Hire fifty new men,\" Ned told him. \"Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin.\"', '\"I will?\" Littlefinger said.', '\"You will.

And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored!', '\"The realm prospers from such events, my lord,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"They bring the great the', 'chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.\"', '\"And put coins in many a pocket,\" Littlefinger added. \"Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are', 'walking bowlegged and jingling with each step.\"', 'Lord Renly laughed. \"We\\'re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us.

The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With', 'Descliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, by Grand Maester Malleon.', 'Pycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt', 'certain he had reasons. There was something here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only', 'he could see it. But what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born', 'when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths.', 'He opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against', 'Page 182', '', 'hope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing their descent back', 'to Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the', 'Builder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who', 'winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to', 'brighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book.', 'A sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon\\'s tome and bid him enter. \"I\\'ve', 'promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,\" he told him. \"I rely on you to', 'make the choice. Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to', 'stop fights, not start them.\" Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. \"Did', 'you find the stableboy?\"', '\"The watchman, my lord,\" Jory said. \"He vows he\\'ll never touch another horse.\"', '\"What did he have to say?\"', '\"He claims he knew Lord Arryn well.

It sounded as if this boy would', 'be even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had', 'spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a', 'new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he', 'would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards . . . even if said captain was ten years older and a', 'hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been', \"reading more than was good for him, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son's frailty,\", 'and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with', 'Lord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the', 'lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, the lord had', 'taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, the lord had visited a master armorer to', 'commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl', \"moon on the breast.

And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to', \"Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother's name. He had given no\", 'word as to when he might return. \"Where did they go on these rides?\" Ned asked.', '\"The boy says that they visited a brothel.\"', '\"A brothel?\" Ned said. \"The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis', 'Page 183', '', 'Baratheon?\" He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit.', \"Robert's lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different\", 'sort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim', 'in his sense of duty.', '\"The boy insists it\\'s true. The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of', 'it when he took their horses afterward.\"', '\"Which brothel?\" Ned asked.', '\"The boy did not know. The guards would.\"', '\"A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,\" Ned said dryly. \"The', 'gods are doing their best to vex us.

Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held', \"Storm's End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and\", 'Redwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls.', '\"Bring me my doublet, if you would.

A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite', \"rose gold locklet.

Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of', 'anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras', 'Tyrell\\'s sister Margaery, he\\'d confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. \"No,\"', 'Ned had told him, bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had', 'conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as more than passing', 'queer.', 'Jory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. \"Perhaps Lord Stannis will', 'return for Robert\\'s tourney,\" he said as Jory laced the garment up the back.', '\"That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,\" Jory said.', 'Ned buckled on a longsword. \"In other words, not bloody likely.\" His smile was grim.', \"Jory draped Ned's cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand's badge of\", 'office. \"The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. Alyn knows', 'Page 184', '', 'the way, my lord.\"', 'Ned nodded. \"The gods help this potboy if he\\'s sent me off haring after shadows.\" It was a slim enough', 'staff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered', 'plate. Steel was steel; it was meant for protection, not ornament. He', 'A GAML OF THRONLS 245', 'might have changed his views, to be sure. He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look', 'on things differently after a few years at court . . . but the change was marked enough to make Ned', 'wonder.', '\"Is there any other service I might perform?\"', '\"I suppose you\\'d best begin visiting whorehouses.\"', '\"Hard duty, my lord.\" Jory grinned. \"The men will be glad to help. Porther has made a fair start already.\"', \"Ned's favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard. Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode\", 'through the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering, yet they said no word of', \"complaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King's Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white\", 'cloak streaming from his shoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot. His guard', 'followed.', 'He looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets. Tomard and', 'Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take, and', \"watch for anyone following them, but even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King's Spider and\", 'his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night.', 'The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as it was named on maps, or the', 'Mud Gate, as it was commonly called. A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some', 'great insect, with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys', 'no older than Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of', 'others. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops', 'on the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing', 'out, \"Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price,\" and \"Blood melons, sweet as honey,\" and', '\"Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here.\"', 'The Mud Gate was open, and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden', 'cloaks, leaning on spears. When a column of riders appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into', 'action, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his', 'escort. The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a', 'living thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. \"Make way for Lord', 'Beric!\" the rider shouted. \"Make wayfor Lord Befic!\" And close behind came the young lord himself, a', 'dashing', 'I', 'figure on a black courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars. \"Here to fight in', 'Page 185', '', 'the Hand\\'s tourney, my lord?\" a guardsman called out to him. \"Here to win the Hand\\'s tourney,\" Lord', 'Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered.', 'Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and', 'followed its winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over', 'mail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons. The farther they', 'climbed, the larger the buildings grew. The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a', 'huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors', 'showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood. A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the', 'entrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn.', 'Ned left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside.', \"The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned's badge and the sigil on his doublet, and the master\", 'came hurrying out, all smiles and bows. \"Wine for the King\\'s Hand,\" he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a', 'couch. \"I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease.\" He wore a black velvet coat', 'with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread, Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and', 'a sapphire as large as a pigeon\\'s egg. \"If you are in need of new arms for the Hand\\'s tourney, you have', 'come to the right shop.\" Ned did not bother to correct him. \"My work is costly, and I make no apologies', 'for', 'that, my lord,\" he said as he filled two matching silver goblets. \"You will not find craftsmanship equal to', \"mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you. Visit every forge in King's Landing if you like, and\", 'compare for yourself. Any village smith can hammer out a shift of mail; my work is art.\"', 'Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here, Tobho', \"boasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king's own\", \"brother. Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly's new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers?\", 'No other armorer in the city could', 'get that deep a green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the', 'crutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian', 'steel at the forges of Oohor as a boy. Only a man who knew', 'the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew. \"The direwolf was the sigil of House Stark, is it', 'not? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street,\" he vowed.', 'Ned smiled. \"Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?\"', 'Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. \"The Hand did call upon me, with Lord', 'Stannis, the king\\'s brother. I regret to say, they did not honor me with their patronage.\"', 'Ned looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found over the years that silence', 'sometimes yielded more than questions. And so it was this time.', '\"They asked to see the boy,\" the armorer said, \"so I took them back to the forge.\"', '\"The boy,\" Ned echoed. He had no notion who the boy might be. \"I should like to see the boy as well.\"', 'Page 186', '', 'Tobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. \"As you wish, my lord,\" he said with no trace of his former', 'friendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn', 'where the work was done. When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through', \"made Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon's mouth. Inside, a forge blazed in each corner,\", 'and the air stank of smoke and sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs', 'just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the', 'bellows.', 'The master called over a tall lad about Robb\\'s age, his arms and chest corded with muscle. \"This is Lord', 'Stark, the new Hand of the King,\" he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and', 'pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink. The', 'shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw. \"This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show', 'the Hand that helmet you made, lad.\" Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench, and a steel helm', \"shaped like a bull's head, with two great curving horns.\", 'Ned turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but expertly shaped. \"This is fine', 'work. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.\"', 'The boy snatched it out of his hands. \"It\\'s not for sale.\"', 'Tobho Mott looked horror-struck. \"Boy, this is the King\\'s Hand. If his lordship wants this helm, make', 'him a gift of it. He honors you by asking.\"', '\"I made it for me,\" the boy said stubbornly.', '\"A hundred pardons, my lord,\" his master said hurriedly to Ned. \"The boy is crude as new steel, and like', \"new steel would profit from some beating. That helm is journeyman's work at best. Forgive him and I\", 'promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen.\"', '\"He\\'s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did', 'you talk about?\"', '\"He asked me questions is all, m\\'lord.\"', '\"What sort of questions?\"', 'The boy shrugged. \"How was 1, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my', 'mother. Who she was and what she looked like and all.\"', '\"What did you tell him?\" Ned asked.', 'The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead. \"She died when I was little. She had yellow', 'hair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. She worked in an alehouse.\"', '\"Did Lord Stannis question you as well?\"', '\"The bald one? No, not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done', 'for his daughter.\"', 'Page 187', '', '\"Mind your filthy tongue,\" the master said. \"This is the King\\'s own Hand.\" The boy lowered his eyes. \"A', 'smart boy, but stubborn. That helm . . . the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.\"', 'Ned touched the boy\\'s head, fingering the thick black hair. \"Look at me, Gendry.\" The apprentice lifted', 'his face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he thought, I see it. \"Go back to', 'your work, lad. I\\'m sorry to have bothered you.\" He walked back to the house with the master. \"Who', 'paid the boy\\'s apprentice fee?\" he asked lightly.', 'Mott looked fretful. \"You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those hands were made', 'for hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.\"', '\"The truth now,\" Ned urged. \"The streets are full of strong boys. The day you take on an apprentice', 'without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?\"', '\"A lord,\" the master said reluctantly. \"He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat. He paid in gold,', 'twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.\"', '\"Describe him.\"', '\"He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I\\'ll', 'swear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the', 'hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear.\" He hesitated a moment. \"My lord, I want no', 'trouble.\"', '\"None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,\" Ned said. \"You know who', 'the boy is.\"', '\"I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I\\'m told.\"', '\"You know who the boy is,\" Ned repeated patiently. \"That is not a question.\"', '\"The boy is my apprentice,\" the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, stubborn as old iron. \"Who he', 'was before he came to me, that\\'s none of my concern.\"', 'Ned nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. \"If the day ever comes when', 'Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me. He has the look of a warrior.

Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her', 'forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look, but for once she did not care. The', \"southern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother's kisses. It\", 'took her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping', \"branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother's laughter as he chased her through piles of\", 'damp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown', \"between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he'd eaten so much mud he was\", 'sick for a week. How young they all had been.', 'Catelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at night it turned to', 'ice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That', 'was no rain for little girls to play in.', '\"I am soaked through,\" Ser Rodrik complained. \"Even my bones are wet.\" The woods pressed close', 'around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds', 'their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud. \"We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot', 'meal would serve us both.\"', '\"There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,\" Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her', 'youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding', 'somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf', 'night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The', 'sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded', \"those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha's teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror.\", '\"An inn,\" Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. \"If only . . . but we dare not risk it. If we wish to remain', 'unknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast . . .\" He broke off as they heard sounds up the', 'road; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse\\'s whinny. \"Riders,\" he warned, his hand dropping to the', 'hilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it never hurt to be wary.', 'They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of armed men noisily', 'fording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider', 'hung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle', 'of Seagard. \"Mallisters,\" Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. \"My lady, best pull up', 'your hood.\"', 'Catelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his knights, his son', \"Patrek by his side and their squires close behind.

For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights', 'and freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of', 'honey, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south.', 'She studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her', 'wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair', 'Page 189', '', 'was salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He', 'rode like a man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the', \"riders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord's courtesy to strangers\", 'chance met on the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a', 'look.', '\"He did not know you,\" Ser Rodrik said after, wondering.', '\"He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would never occur to', 'him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the', 'inn, Ser Rodrik.\"', 'It was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident.', 'Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave', 'them only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. \"Two rooms at the top of', 'the stair, that\\'s all there is,\" she said, chewing all the while. \"They\\'re under the bell tower, you won\\'t be', \"missing meals, though there's some thinks it too noisy.

If\", 'only her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these', 'past two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now.', 'The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into', 'the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony', 'Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky.', 'There she would find her sister . . . and, perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew', 'more than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the', 'Lannisters to ruin, and if it came to', 'war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service.', 'Yet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and', 'the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away', 'like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord', 'Page 190', '', 'as any the Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains.', \"Catelyn's only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty.\", 'No, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to Winterfell, where her', 'sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, she could declare', \"herself to one of Ned's bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the\", 'kingsroad.', 'The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her', 'memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile farther on, half a hundred white', 'cottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and', 'peaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and', 'green woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords.', 'Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels her father was', 'obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of', 'Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children,', 'grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were', 'bannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would', \"be enough, if it came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who'd ever lived, and she had no doubt\", 'that he would call his banners . . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons', 'had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while', 'Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army', 'he had planned to join (theirs, he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her', 'father had called him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must', 'not let it.', 'Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. \"We had best make haste if we hope to eat', 'tonight, my lady.\"', '\"It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the', 'Neck,\" she told him. \"Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on', 'some family business, say.\"', '\"As you say, my lady,\" Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized what he\\'d', 'done. \"The old courtesies die hard, my-my daughter.\" He tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed', 'with exasperation.', 'Catelyn took his arm. \"Come, Father,\" she said. \"You\\'ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I', 'think, but try not to praise her. You truly don\\'t want to see her smile.\"', 'The common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at', 'the other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs,', 'chewing her sourleaf all the while.', 'The benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers. The', 'crossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen', 'reeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten', 'Page 191', '', 'sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions.', 'The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the fire wore the red', 'stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery', 'grey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces,', 'but they were all too young to have known her. The senior among them would have been no older than', 'Bran when she went north.', 'Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a handsome', 'youth was fingering a woodharp. \"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,\" he said as they sat. An empty wine', 'cup stood on the table before him.', '\"And to you, singer,\" Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that', 'meant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were', 'going, and from whence they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as', 'arrows and never pausing for an answer. \"We left King\\'s Landing a fortnight ago,\" Catelyn replied,', 'answering the safest of his questions.', '\"That\\'s where I\\'m bound,\" the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his', 'own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. \"The', \"Hand's tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I\", \"came away with more silver than I could carry ... or would have, if I hadn't lost it all betting on the\", 'Kingslayer to win the day.\"', '\"The gods frown on the gambler,\" Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and shared the Stark', 'views on tournaments.', '\"They frowned on me, for certain,\" the singer said. \"Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers', 'altogether did me in.\"', '\"No doubt that was a lesson for you,\" Ser Rodrik said.', '\"It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.\"', 'Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could frame a rebuke the serving', 'boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned', 'meat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat', 'mushrooms. Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer.', '\"My name is Marillion,\" the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. \"Doubtless you\\'ve heard me', 'play somewhere?\"', 'His manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell, but she', 'knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. \"I fear not,\" she told him.', 'He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. \"That is your loss,\" he said. \"Who was the finest singer', 'you\\'ve ever heard?\"', 'Page 192', '', '\"Alia of Braavos,\" Ser Rodrik answered at once.', '\"Oh, I\\'m much better than that old stick,\" Marillion said. \"If you have the silver for a song, I\\'ll gladly', 'show you.\"', '\"I might have a copper or two, but I\\'d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,\" Ser Rodrik', 'groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not', 'comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword.', '\"Your grandfather has a sour nature,\" Marillion said to Catelyn. \"I meant to do you honor. An homage to', 'your beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.\"', '\"Oh, I can see that,\" Catelyn said. \"Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doubt you\\'ve been to', 'Riverrun.\"', '\"A hundred times,\" the singer said airily. \"They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a', 'brother.\"', 'Catelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once bedded a girl her', 'brother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. \"And Winterfell?\" she asked him. \"Have you traveled', 'north?\"', '\"Why would IT\\' Marillion asked. \"It\\'s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music', 'but the howling of wolves.\"', 'Distantly, she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room.', '\"Innkeep,\" a servant\\'s voice called out behind her, \"we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of', 'Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.\"', '\"Oh, gods,\" Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard', 'around his forearm.', 'Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. \"I\\'m sorry, m\\'lord, truly, we\\'re full up,', 'every room.\"', \"There were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night's Watch, two servants . . .\", 'and him, standing there small and bold as life. \"My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I', 'do not require a large room, as you can plainly see.\" He flashed a mocking grin. \"So long as the fire\\'s', 'warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man.\"', 'Masha Heddle was beside herself. \"M\\'lord, there\\'s nothing, it\\'s the tourney, there\\'s no help for it, oh . . .\"', 'Tyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head, caught it, tossed it again.', 'Even across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold was unmistakable.', 'A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet. \"You\\'re welcome to my room, m\\'lord.\"', '\"Now there\\'s a clever man,\" Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room. The freerider', 'Page 193', '', 'snatched it from the air. \"And a nimble one to boot.\" The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle. \"You will', 'be able to manage food, I trust?\"', '\"Anything you like, m1ord, anything at all,\" the innkeep promised. And may he choke on it, Catelyn', 'thought, but it was Bran she saw choking, drowning on his own blood.', 'Lannister glanced at the nearest tables. \"My men will have whatever you\\'re serving these people. Double', \"portions, we've had a long hard ride. I'll take a roast fowl-chicken, duck, pigeon, it makes no matter.\", 'And send up a flagon of your best wine. Yoren, will you sup with me?\"', '\"Aye, m1ord, I will,\" the black brother replied.', 'The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how', 'grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet.', '\"My lord of Lannister!\" he called out. \"I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you', 'the lay of your father\\'s great victory at King\\'s Landing!\"', '\"Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,\" the dwarf said', 'dryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away . . . and found Catelyn.', 'He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling.', '\"Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,\" he said. \"I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.\"', 'Marillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet. She heaTd', 'SeT Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only . . .', '\"Lady . . . Stark?\" Masha Heddle said thickly.', '\"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,\" she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering,', 'feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords,', 'and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no', 'time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. \"You in the', 'corner,\" she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. \"Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see', 'embroidered on your surcoat, ser?\"', 'The man got to his feet. \"It is, my lady.\"', '\"And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?\"', '\"She is,\" the man replied stoutly.', 'Ser Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was blinking at them,', 'blank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes.', '\"The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,\" she said to the trio by the fire. \"My father counts', 'Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.\"', 'The three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. \"Our lord is honored by his trust,\" one of them said', 'hesitantly.', 'Page 194', '', '\"I envy your father all these fine friends,\" Lannister quipped, \"but I do not quite see the purpose of this,', 'Lady Stark.\"', 'She ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the heart of the matter; there', 'were more than twenty of them. \"I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey. How fares your good', 'lord, sers?\"', 'Their captain rose. \"Lord Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name', 'day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.\"', 'Tyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. \"This man came a guest into my', 'house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,\" she proclaimed to the room at large,', 'I', 'pointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, his sword in hand. \"In the name of King Robert and the good', \"lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's\", 'justice.\"', 'She did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on', \"Tyrion Lannister's face.\", 'SANSA', \"Sansa rode to the Hand's tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with curtains of\", 'yellow silk so fine she could see right through them. They turned the whole world gold. Beyond the city', 'walls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river, and the common folk came out in the', \"thousands to watch the games. The splendor of it all took Sansa's breath away; the shining armor, the\", 'great chargers caparisoned in silver and gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the wind .', '. . and the knights themselves, the knights most of all.', '\"It is better than the songs,\" she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her,', 'among the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out', 'the auburn of her hair, and she knew they were looking at her and smiling.', 'They watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last. The seven', 'knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, their', 'cloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining', \"gold from head to foot, with a lion'shead helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain\", 'That Rides, thundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had', 'guested at Winterfell two years', '260 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN', 'before. \"His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that', 'ward him against harm,\" she whispered to Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in', 'Page 195', '', \"indigo chased with silver, the wings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar's\", 'bannermen on the Trident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red', 'robes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming', 'sword in hand.', 'Other riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and the mountains of', 'Dorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser', 'houses. Younger men, most had done no great deeds as yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day', 'the Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names. Ser Balon Swann. Lord Bryce Caron', \"of the Marches. Bronze Yohn's heir, Ser Andar Royce, and his younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered\", 'steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father. The twins Ser Horas', 'and Ser Hobber, whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the Redwynes, burgundy on blue.', \"Patrek Mallister, Lord Jason's son. Six Freys of the Crossing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser\", 'Emmon, Ser Theo, Ser Perwyn, sons and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey, and his bastard son', 'Martyn Rivers as well.', 'Jeyne Poole confessed herself frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince from the Summer', 'Isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night, but when she saw young', 'Lord Beric Dondarrion, with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning, she', 'pronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant.', \"The Hound entered the lists as well, and so too the king's brother, handsome Lord Renly of Storm's\", 'End. Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. \"Jory looks a beggar among these others,\"', \"Septa Mordane sniffed when he appeared. Sansa could only agree. Jory's armor was blue-grey plate\", 'without device or ornament, and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he', 'acquitted himself well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In', 'his third match, he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his', \"own. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune's lance was steadier and his blows better placed, and the king\", 'gave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn', 'of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann.', 'The jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great', 'warhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times', 'Jeyne and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters while the', 'commons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell, like a frightened little', 'girl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew how to behave at tournaments. Even Septa', 'Mordane noted her composure and nodded in approval.', 'The Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as', 'easily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy,', 'who had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior.', 'Sandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed unstoppable as well, riding', 'down one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser', \"Gregor's second joust, when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget\", 'with such force that it drove through his throat, killing him instantly. The youth fell not ten feet from where', \"Sansa was seated.

His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of', 'Page 196', '', 'fire ran down his outstretched arm, as the steel caught the light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it', \"was gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summer's day, trimmed with a border of\", 'crescent moons, but as his blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by', 'one.', 'Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure, but', 'Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange fascination. She had never seen a man', 'die before. She ought to be crying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used', 'up all her tears for Lady and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she', 'told herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the Vale of Arryn', 'whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world would forget his name too,', 'Sansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That was sad.', 'After they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot', 'where he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed.', 'Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed so violently', 'that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit the ground with an audible', 'crack', 'that made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off', \"beneath him. When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert's\", 'handsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a', 'gracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the commons', 'began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored', 'the peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; she had', 'helped her back to the castle. Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne.', \"Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion's horse, and\", 'was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new mount, only to be knocked right off it by', 'Thoros of Myr.

At', 'sixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that', 'morning in his first three jousts. Sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful. His plate was intricately', 'fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion was', 'draped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove his helm and', 'ride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair', 'maiden in the crowd.', \"His last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar's ancestral runes proved small\", 'protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in', 'the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field. Finally they called for a litter and', 'carried him off to his tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras.', 'When the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst.', 'Page 197', '', 'To the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red. \"Sweet lady,\" he', 'said, \"no victory is half so beautiful as you.\" Sansa took the flower timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry.', 'His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes like liquid', 'gold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off.', 'When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with a pointed beard', 'and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. \"You must be one of her daughters,\" he said to', 'her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. \"You have the Tully look.\"', '\"I\\'m Sansa Stark,\" she said, ill at ease.

His breath smelled of mint. \"You', 'have her hair.\" His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he', 'turned and walked away.', 'By then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed that the last three matches', 'would be fought the next morning, before the melee. While the commons began their walk home, talking', \"of the day's jousts and the matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the\", 'feast. Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden spits while', 'kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit. Tables and benches had', 'been raised outside the pavilions, piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-baked bread.', 'Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the raised dais where the king', 'himself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her right, she felt her throat tighten.', 'He had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened, and she had not dared to speak to', \"him.

He wore a deep blue doublet studded', \"with a double row of golden lion's heads, and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and\", 'sapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. Sansa looked at him and trembled, afraid that he might', 'ignore her or, worse, turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table.', 'Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant', 'as any prince in the songs, and said, \"Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.\"', '\"He was too kind,\" she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though her heart was singing. \"Ser', 'Loras is a true knight. Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?\"', 'Page 198', '', '\"No,\" Jofftey said. \"My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am', 'old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.\" He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon', 'of iced surnmerwine, and poured her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Jofftey leaned', \"over and filled the septa's cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another\", 'word.', 'The servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine. She', 'needed no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties', \"she had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know. Singers sat before the king's pavilion, filling\", \"the dusk with music. A juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The king's own\", 'fool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock of', 'everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was', 'helpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled', 'wine on herself.', 'And Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments,', \"making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy's japes. Sansa was so\", 'captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left.', 'All the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of sweetgrass and', 'spinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails', 'before; Jofftey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself.', 'Then came trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to', 'expose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her himself,', \"slicing a queen's portion from the joint, smiling as he laid it on her plate. She could see from the way he\", 'moved that his right arm was still troubling him, yet he uttered not a word of complaint.', 'Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes', 'frosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon', 'cakes, as much as she loved them. She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king', 'began to shout.', 'King Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or', 'roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for', 'her to make out his words.', 'Now everybody heard him. \"No, \" he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa', 'was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he', 'was drunk as a man could be. \"You do not tell me what to do, woman,\" he screamed at Queen Cersei. \"I', 'am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!\"', \"Everyone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king's brother Renly, and the short man who\", \"had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere.

He had a queer look', 'on his face, as if he were not seeing her at all. \"Do you need an escort back to the castle?\"', '\"No,\" Sansa began. She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her head on the', 'table, snoring soft and ladylike snores. \"I mean to say . . . yes, thank you, that would be most kind. I am', 'tired, and the way is so dark. I should be glad for some protection.\"', 'Joffrey called out, \"Dog!\"', 'Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he appear. He had exchanged his', \"armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog's head sewn on the front. The light of the torches made\", 'his burned face shine a dull red. \"Yes, Your Grace?\" he said.', '\"Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls', 'her,\" the prince told him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her', 'there.', 'Sansa could feel the Hound watching her. \"Did you think Joff was going to take you himself?\" He', 'laughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. \"Small chance of that.\" He pulled her unresisting', 'to her feet. \"Come, you\\'re not the only one needs sleep. I\\'ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my', 'brother tomorrow.\" He laughed again.', \"Suddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane's shoulder, hoping to wake her, but she only snored\", 'the louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty. The feast was over,', 'and the beautiful dream had ended with it.', 'The Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside him. The ground was', 'rocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her. She kept her eyes', 'lowered, watching where she placed her feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and', 'its armor hung outside, the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of', 'him, he frightened her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not', 'notice his face, she told herself. \"You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,\" she made herself say.', 'Sandor Clegane snarled at her. \"Spare me your empty little compliments, girl . . . and your ser\\'s. I am no', 'knight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. Did you see him ride today?\"', '\"Yes,\" Sansa whispered, trembling. \"He was', '\"Gallant?\" the Hound finished.', 'Page 200', '', 'He was mocking her, she realized. \"No one could withstand him,\" she managed at last, proud of herself.', 'It was no lie.', 'Sandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She had no choice but to', 'stop beside him. \"Some septa trained you well. You\\'re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles,', 'aren\\'t you? A pretty little talking -bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.\"', '\"That\\'s unkind.\" Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. \"You\\'re frightening me. I want to go', 'now.\"', '\"No one could withstand him, \" the Hound rasped. \"That\\'s truth enough. No one could ever withstand', 'Gregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business. You saw that, did you?', 'Fool boy, he had no business riding in this company. No money, no squire, no one to help him with that', \"armor. That gorget wasn't fastened proper. You think Gregor didn't notice that? You think Ser Gregor's\", 'lance rode up by chance, do you? Pretty little talking girl, you', \"believe that, you're empty-headed as a bird for true. Gregor's lance goes where Gregor wants it to go.\", 'Look at me. Look at me!\" Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up. He', 'squatted in front of her, and moved the torch close. \"There\\'s a pretty for you. Take a good long stare.', \"You know you want to. I've watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad. Piss on that.\", 'Take your look.\"', 'His fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. Drunken eyes, sullen with anger.', 'She had to look.', 'The right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow. His', 'nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair', 'grew on the other side of that face.', 'The left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left but a hole. His', 'eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked', 'with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw,', 'you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away.', 'Sansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. \"No pretty words for', 'that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?\" When there was no answer, he continued. \"Most of', 'them, they think it was some battle. A siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it', 'was dragonsbreath.\" His laugh was softer this time, but just as bitter. \"I\\'ll tell you what it was, girl,\" he', 'said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine', 'on his breath. \"I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under', \"my father's keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don't remember\", \"what I got, but it was Gregor's gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged\", 'separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy', 'was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his', 'knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me.', 'There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved', 'the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You', 'saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about', \"the seven hells. What do they know?

He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night,', 'hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She was sad for him, she realized.', 'Somehow, the fear had gone away.', 'The silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she was afraid for him', 'now, not for herself. She found his massive shoulder with her hand. \"He was no true knight,\" she', 'whispered to him.', 'The Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but he caught her', 'arm. \"No,\" he growled at her, \"no, little bird, he was no true knight.\"', 'The rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her to where the carts were', 'waiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after her. They rode in silence', \"through the King's Gate and up torchlit city streets. He opened the postern door and led her into the\", 'castle, his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding, and he was one step behind her as they climbed', 'the tower stairs. He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber.', '\"Thank you, my lord,\" Sansa said meekly.', 'The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close. \"The things I told you tonight,\" he said, his voice', 'sounding even rougher than usual. \"If you ever tell Joffrey.... your sister, your father. . . any of them . . .\"', '\"I won\\'t,\" Sansa whispered. \"I promise.\"', 'It was not enough. \"If you ever tell anyone,\" he finished, \"I\\'ll kill you.\"', 'EDDARD', '\"I stood last vigil for him myself,\" Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back', 'of the cart. \"He had no one else. A mother in the Vale, I am told.\"', 'In the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. He had not been handsome,', 'but death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet', 'tunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his', 'face, and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman', 'before Ned could speak to him; could that be mere happenstance? He supposed he would never know.', '\"Hugh was Jon Arryn\\'s squire for four years,\" Selmy went on. \"The king knighted him before he rode', 'north, in Jon\\'s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was not ready.\"', 'Page 202', '', 'Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. \"None of us is ever ready,\" he said.', '\"For knighthood?\"', '\"For death.\" Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent', 'moons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had', 'fought to honor the King\\'s Hand, Eddard Stark. \"This was needless. War should not be a game.\" Ned', 'turned to the woman beside', 'the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes. The silent sisters prepared men for the grave,', 'and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death. \"Send his armor home to the Vale. The mother will', 'want to have it.\"', '\"It is worth a fair piece of silver,\" Ser Barristan said. \"The boy had it forged special for the tourney. Plain', 'work, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.\"', '\"He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,\" Ned replied. And to the silent sister he said, \"Send the', 'mother the armor. I will deal with this smith.\" She bowed her head.', \"Afterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king's pavilion. The camp was beginning to stir. Fat\", 'sausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with the scents of garlic and pepper. Young squires', 'hurried about on errands as their masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man', 'with a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them. \"NI\\'lords,\" he muttered as the', 'goose honked and pecked at his fingers.

Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news.

It was all of golden silk, the largest and grandest structure in the camp. Outside the entrance,', \"Robert's warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of\", 'House Baratheon.', 'Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not with him. They', 'found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who', 'were trying to buckle him into his armor. \"Your Grace,\" one was', 'Page 203', '', 'saying, almost in tears, \"it\\'s made too small, it won\\'t go.\" He fumbled, and the gorget he was trying to fit', \"around Robert's thick neck tumbled to the ground.\", '\"Seven hells!\" Robert swore. \"Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of you. Pick it up. Don\\'t just', 'stand there gaping, Lance], pick it up!\" The lad jumped, and the king noticed his company. \"Look at', \"these oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me, and they're worse than useless. Can't\", 'even put a man\\'s armor on him properly. Squires, they say. I say they\\'re swineherds dressed up in silk.\"', 'Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. \"The boys are not at fault,\" he told the king.', '\"You\\'re too fat for your armor, Robert.\"', 'Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs, wiped his', 'mouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, \"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king?\"', 'He let go his laughter, sudden as a storm. \"Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?\"', 'The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. \"You. Yes, both of you. You heard the', 'Hand. The king is too fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron Santagar. Tell him I need the breastplate', 'stretcher. Now! What are you waiting for?\"', 'The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent. Robert managed to keep a stern', 'face until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a chair, shaking with laughter.', 'Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. Always, though, the', 'graver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the two squires: handsome boys, fair and well', \"made. One was Sansa's age, with long golden curls; the other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired, with a wisp\", 'of a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen.', '\"Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar\\'s face,\" Robert said. \"I hope he\\'ll have the wit to send them', 'to someone else. We ought to keep them running all day!\"', '\"Those boys,\" Ned asked him. \"Lannisters?\"', 'Robert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. \"Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin\\'s brother. One of the dead', \"ones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it. I don't recall. My wife comes from a very\", 'large family, Ned.\"', 'A very ambitious family, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but it troubled him to see', \"Robert surrounded by the queen's kin, waking and sleeping. The Lannister appetite for offices and honors\", 'seemed to know no bounds. \"The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night.\"', 'The mirth curdled on Robert\\'s face. \"The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee. She\\'s sulking in', 'the castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have shamed me like that.\"', '\"You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,\" Ned told him. \"You saw her beauty, but not the iron', 'underneath. She would have told you that you have no business in the melee.\"', 'Page 204', '', '\"You too?\" The king frowned. \"You are a sour man, Stark. Too long in the north, all the juices have', 'frozen inside you. Well, mine are still running.\" He slapped his chest to prove it.', '\"You are the king,\" Ned reminded him.', '\"I sit on the damn iron seat when I must.

There\\'s not a man in', 'the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting', 'YOU.\"', 'The king rose to his feet, his face flushed. \"Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win?\"', '\"For a certainty,\" Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord.', 'For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the tent, whirled, strode back,', 'his face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy', 'in a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. \"Get out,\" the king said then, coldly. \"Get out before I kill you.\"', 'Ser Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out again. \"Not you, Ned.\"', 'Ned turned back.

His face was dark with fury and his hair fell', 'down into his eyes. \"My sword,\" he shouted to his squire, and the boy ran it out to him. By then his', 'stallion was back on its feet as well.', \"Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the animal's neck.\", 'Cheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat. The stallion went to its knees, screaming as it died. By then', 'Gregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell, his bloody sword clutched in his fist. \"Stop', 'him!\" Ned shouted, but his words were lost in the roar. Everyone else was yelling as well, and Sansa was', 'crying.', 'It all happened so fast. The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword as Ser Gregor knocked', 'his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse. The mare scented blood and reared. Loras', 'Tyrell kept his seat, but barely. Ser Gregor swung his sword, a savage twohanded blow that took the', 'boy in the chest and knocked him from the saddle. The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras lay', 'stunned in the dirt. But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow, a rasping voice warned, \"Leave him', 'be, \" and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy.', 'The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive', 'strength behind it, but the Hound caught the blow and turned it, and for what seemed an eternity the two', 'brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw', 'Page 209', '', \"Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the hound's-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his\", \"brother's unprotected face.\", \"It was the king's voice that put an end to it . . . the king's voice and twenty swords. Jon Arryn had told\", 'them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, and Robert had proved the truth of that on the', 'Trident. He used that voice now. \"STOP THIS MADNESS, \" he boomed, \"IN THE NAME OF', 'YOUR KING!\"', \"The Hound went to one knee. Ser Gregor's blow cut air, and at last he came to his senses. He dropped\", 'his sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by his Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen.', 'Wordlessly, he turned and strode off, shoving past Barristan Selmy. \"Let him go,\" Robert said, and as', 'quickly as that, it was over.', '\"Is the Hound the champion now?\" Sansa asked Ned.', '\"No,\" he told her. \"There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers.\"', 'But Sansa had the right of it after all. A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back onto the field in', 'a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane, \"I owe you my life. The day is yours, ser.\"', '\"I am no ser,\" the Hound replied, but he took the victory, and the champion\\'s purse, and, for perhaps the', 'first time in his life, the love of the commons. They cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion.', 'As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in', 'with them. \"Tyrell had to', 'know the mare was in heat,\" Littlefinger was saying. \"I swear the boy planned the whole thing. Gregor', 'has always favored huge, ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense.\" The notion seemed to amuse', 'him.', 'It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy. \"There is small honor in tricks,\" the old man said stiffly.', '\"Small honor and twenty thousand golds.\" Lord Renly smiled.', 'That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the Dornish Marches, won the', 'archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the', 'other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him', \"a position with the Hand's guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of,\", 'and he refused.', 'The melee went on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and hedge knights and', 'new-made squires in search of a reputation. They fought with blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and', 'blood, small troops fighting together and then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured,', 'until only one man was left standing. The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who', 'shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened', 'the mounts of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. The final tally was three broken limbs, a', 'shattered collarbone, a dozen smashed fingers, two horses that had to be put down, and more cuts,', 'sprains, and bruises than anyone cared to count. Ned was desperately pleased that Robert had not taken', 'part.', 'Page 210', '', 'That night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great while. Robert was in', 'high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and even his daughters were behaving. Jory', 'brought Arya down to join them, and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly. \"The tournament was', 'magnificent,\" she sighed. \"You should have come. How was your dancing?\"', '\"I\\'m sore all over,\" Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg.', '\"You must be a terrible dancer,\" Sansa said doubtfully.', 'Later, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven', 'ballads called the \"Dance of the Dragons,\" Ned inspected the bruise himself. \"I hope Forel is not being', 'too hard on you,\" he said.', 'Arya stood on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. \"Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson,', 'and every lesson makes you better.\"', 'Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi', \"style was well suited to Arya's slender blade, yet still . . . a few days ago, she had been wandering\", 'around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes. Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her', 'nose and her skin, she told him. Before that, he had her doing spins and back flips. \"Arya, are you certain', 'you want to persist in this?\"', 'She nodded. \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to catch cats.\"', '\"Cats.\" Ned sighed. \"Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask Jory to take', 'over your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven', 'Kingdoms in his youth.\"', '\"I don\\'t want them,\" Arya said. \"I want Syrio.\"', 'Ned ran his fingers through his hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of', 'slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping about on one leg, but he', 'knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw. \"As', 'you wish,\" he said. Surely she would grow tired of this soon. \"Try to be careful.\"', '\"I will,\" she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left.', 'Much later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in bed, Sansa with', 'her dreams and Arya with her bruises, Ned ascended to his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand.', 'The day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the', 'heavy shutters to let in the cool night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of', \"candlelight from Littlefinger's windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels\", 'were only now beginning to dwindle and die.', \"He took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger's blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager,\", 'sent to slay Bran in his sleep. Why? Why would the dwarf want Bran dead?

Gendry had to be', \"Robert's.\", 'Yet knowing all that, what had he learned? The king had other baseborn children scattered throughout', \"the Seven Kingdoms.

Ned was often', 'dragged along for company, whether he willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, he', 'realized; older than Robert had been when he fathered her. A strange thought.', \"Cersei could not have been pleased by her lord husband's by-blows, yet in the end it mattered little\", 'whether the king had one bastard or a hundred.

Not until they were alone', 'behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl.', '\"Lord Varys?\" Ned said in astonishment.', '\"Lord Stark,\" Varys said politely, seating himself. \"I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink?\"', 'Ned filled two cups with surnmerwine and handed one to Varys. \"I might have passed within a foot of', 'you and never recognized you,\" he said, incredulous. He had never seen the eunuch dress in anything but', 'silk and velvet and the richest damasks, and this man smelled of sweat instead of lilacs.', 'Page 212', '', '\"That was my dearest hope,\" Varys said. \"It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken', 'in private. The queen watches you closely. This wine is very choice. Thank you.\"', '\"How did you get past my other guards?\" Ned asked. Porther and Cayn had been posted outside the', 'tower, and Alyn on the stairs.', '\"The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.\" Varys smiled apologetically. \"I will not', \"keep you long, my lord.

She asked him', 'not to fight!\"', '\"She forbade him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the court. Tell me truly, do you', 'know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee? I ask you.\"', 'Ned had a sick feeling in his gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon he could not,', 'should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done. \"Even if he\\'d fought, who would have', 'dared to strike the king?\"', 'Varys shrugged. \"There were forty riders in the melee.

I was curious to see what you', 'would do. Why not come to me? you ask, and I must answer, Why, because I did not trust you, my lord.', '\"You did not trust me?\" Ned was frankly astonished.', '\"The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,\" Varys said. \"Those who are loyal to the', 'realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. Until this morning, I could not say which you might be', '. . . so I waited to see . . . and now I know, for a certainty.\" He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a', 'moment his private face and public mask were one. \"I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so', 'much. Oh, yes I do.\"', '\"You are the one she ought to fear,\" Ned said.', '\"No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him.

Oh, but which one?', 'There were many such.

Particularly my horse.\"', '\"Meat is meat,\" Bronn said with a shrug. \"The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork.\"', 'Page 215', '', '\"Do you take me for a Dothraki?\" Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left', 'deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars.

If you ever see him again.\" Chiggen grinned, showing yellow teeth, and', 'swallowed the raw meat in two bites. \"Tastes well bred.\"', '\"Better if you fry it up with onions,\" Bronn put in.', 'Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs were so sore he', 'could scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one. He had hours more riding ahead of him,', 'followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the', 'same, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. \"Damn her,\" he muttered as', 'he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, \"damn her and all the Starks.\"', \"The memory was still bitter.

The horses had drunk', 'their fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the', 'rock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, sullen and miserable. Mohor stood over them, leaning on his', 'spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby,', 'Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings.', '\"We must have some rest, my lady,\" the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as', 'Tyrion approached. He was Lady', \"Whent's man, stiff-necked and stolid, and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn.\", '\"Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,\" Ser Rodrik said. \"This is the third horse we have lost-\"', '\"We will lose more than horses if we\\'re overtaken by the Lannisters,\" she reminded them. Her face was', 'windburnt and gaunt, but it had lost none of its determination.', '\"Small chance of that here,\" Tyrion put in.', '\"The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,\" snapped Kurleket, a great fat oaf with short-cropped hair and', \"a pig's face. He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made\", 'a special effort to learn all their names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A', 'Lannister always paid his debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as would his friends Lharys and', 'Mohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp', 'lesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to', 'rhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage.', '\"Let him speak,\" Lady Stark commanded.', 'Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock. \"By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck, chasing', 'your lie up the kingsroad . . . assuming there is a pursuit, which is by no means certain. Oh, no doubt the', 'word has reached my father . . . but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that', 'he will bother to bestir himself.\" It was only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for his', 'deformed son, but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House. \"This is a cruel land, Lady Stark.', \"You'll find no succor until you reach the Vale, and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more.\", 'Worse, you risk losing me.

Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid man. Only a fool would arm a', 'common footpad with his own blade.\"', 'Just for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what she said was, \"Why would', 'Petyr lie to me?\"', '\"Why does a bear shit in the woods?\" he demanded. \"Because it is his nature. Lying comes as easily as', 'breathing to a man like Littlefinger. You ought to know that, you of all people.\"', 'She took a step toward him, her face tight. \"And what does that mean, Lannister?\"', 'Tyrion cocked his head. \"Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my', 'lady.\"', '\"That is a lie!\" Catelyn Stark said.', '\"Oh, wicked little imp,\" Marillion said, shocked.', 'Kurleket drew his dirk, a vicious piece of black iron. \"At your word, m\\'lady, I\\'ll toss his lying tongue at', 'your feet.\" His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect.', 'Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen. \"Petyr Baelish', 'loved me once. He was only a boy. His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and', 'nothing to be made mock of. He wanted my hand. That is the truth of the matter.

Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise', \"you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it's those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and\", 'the heat between your legs.\"', 'Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk, baring his throat. Tyrion felt', 'the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin. \"Shall I bleed him, my lady?\"', '\"Kill me and the truth dies with me,\" Tyrion gasped.', '\"Let him talk,\" Catelyn Stark commanded.', \"Kurleket let go of Tyrion's hair, reluctantly.\", 'Tyrion took a deep breath. \"How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his? Answer me that.\"', '\"You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name day.\"', '\"When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?\"', 'Page 220', '', '\"It was,\" she admitted. A line creased her brow.', '\"Riders!\"', 'The shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them. Ser', 'Rodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest.', 'For a long second, no one moved. Catelyn Stark was the first to react. \"Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, to', 'horse,\" she shouted. \"Get the other mounts behind us. Mohor, guard the prisoners-\"', '\"Arm us!\" Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm. \"You will need every sword.\"', 'She knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the', 'great houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor, as they slaughtered each other.', 'They might spare Catelyn herself; she was still young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated.', '\"I hear them!\" Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and there it was: hoofbeats, a', 'dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving, reaching for weapons, running to', 'their mounts.', 'Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge. He landed', 'breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking', 'out from under a conical steel cap. \"Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,\" he said, breathless. \"Milk Snakes', 'or Moon Brothers, by my guess. They must have eyes out, m1ady . . . hidden watchers . . . they know', 'we\\'re here.\"', 'Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand.

Tyrion grinned crookedly. \"Oh, that you have, my lady . .', '. on my honor as a Lannister.\"', 'For a moment he thought she would spit at him, but instead she snapped, \"Arm them,\" and as quick as', 'that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the', 'foe. Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver, and went to one knee beside the road. He was a better', 'archer than swordsman. And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe.', '\"I have never fought with an axe.\" The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands. It had a short', 'Page 221', '', 'haft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top.', '\"Pretend you\\'re splitting logs,\" Bronn said, drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back.', 'He spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik. Ser Willis mounted up to join them,', 'fumbling with his helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume.', '\"Logs don\\'t bleed,\" Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without armor. He looked around', 'for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding. \"Move over.\"', '\"Go away!\" the boy screamed back at him. \"I\\'m a singer, I want no part of this fight!\"', '\"What, lost your taste for adventure?\" Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over, and not a moment', 'too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them.', 'There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and', 'Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled', 'leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred halffielms. In gloved hands were clutched all', 'manner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy', 'iron mauls. At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed', 'greatsword.', 'Ser Rodrik shouted \"Winterfell!\" and rode to meet him, with Bronn and Chiggen beside him, screaming', 'some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around his head.', '\"Harrenhal! Harrenhal!\" he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out,', '\"Casterly Rock!\" but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower.', \"He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. Chiggen's sword raked\", 'across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting', 'down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses', 'dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped', 'bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak.', 'When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting', 'someone else.', 'Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock.', 'Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the', 'rider turned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The', 'blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost', 'his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out', 'of the way. Marillion was less fortunate. Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the', \"singer. Tyrion danced back in while the brigand's leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount, and buried\", \"the axe in the man's neck, just above the shoulder blades.\", 'As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies. \"Someone help', 'me,\" the singer gasped. \"Gods have mercy, I\\'m bleeding.\"', '\"I believe that\\'s horse blood,\" Tyrion said. The singer\\'s hand came crawling out from beneath the dead', 'animal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs. Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt', 'Page 222', '', 'a satisfying crunch. \"Close your eyes and pretend you\\'re dead,\" he advised the singer before he hefted', 'the axe and turned away.', 'After that, things ran together. The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of', 'blood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks. He', 'saw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a sword in each hand. Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight, sliding', 'from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a', \"wounded clansman and left him dead, helping himself to the man's halfhelm. It fit too snugly, but Tyrion\", 'was glad of any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him,', \"and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket's body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but\", \"Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man's dead fingers. He was sliding it through his belt\", \"when he heard a woman's scream.\", 'Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her, one still', 'mounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands, but her', 'back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion', 'thought, and welcome to her, yet somehow he was moving. He caught the first man in the back of the', 'knee before they even knew he was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood.', 'Logs that bleed, Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword,', 'lashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward . . . and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and', 'opened his throat. The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off', 'suddenly.', 'Tyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow the fighting had ended', \"when he wasn't looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all around, screaming or moaning. To his\", 'vast astonishment, he was not one of them. He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground. His', 'hands were sticky with blood. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but the sun', 'seemed scarcely to have moved at all.', '\"Your first battle?\" Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck\\'s body, pulling off his boots. They were good', \"boots, as befit one of Lord Tywin's men; heavy leather, oiled and supple, much finer than what Bronn\", 'was wearing.', 'Tyrion nodded. \"My father will be so proud,\" he said. His legs were cramping so badly he could', 'scarcely stand. Odd, he had never once noticed the pain during the battle.', '\"You need a woman now,\" Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes. He shoved the boots into his', 'saddlebag. \"Nothing like a woman after a man\\'s been blooded, take my word.\"', 'Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips.', 'Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik\\'s wounds. \"I\\'m willing if she is,\" he', \"said. The freeriders broke into laughter, and Tyrion grinned and thought, There's a start.\", 'Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice. As he limped', 'back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were thin, ragged men, their horses', 'scrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were', 'none too impressive. Mauls, clubs, a scythe . . . He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak', 'who had dueled Ser Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword, but when he found his corpse sprawled on', 'Page 223', '', 'the stony ground, the man was not so big after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade', 'was badly notched, its cheap steel spotted with rust. Small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on', 'the ground.', \"They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken's men-at-arms, Kurleket and Mohor, and his own man\", 'Jyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge. A fool to the end, Tyrion thought.', '\"Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,\" Ser Willis Wode said, his eyes scanning the', 'ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm. \"We drove them off for the moment, but they will not have', 'gone far.\"', '\"We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,\" she said. \"These were brave men. I will not leave them to the', 'crows and shadowcats.\"', '\"This soil is too stony for digging,\" Ser Willis said.', '\"Then we shall gather stones for cairns.\"', '\"Gather all the stones you want,\" Bronn told her, \"but do it without me or Chiggen. I\\'ve better things to', 'do than pile rocks on dead men . . . breathing, for one.\" He looked over the rest of the survivors. \"Any of', 'you who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.\"', '\"My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,\" Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been wounded in the', 'fight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck, and he sounded his age. \"If we', 'linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack.\"', 'Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn\\'s face, but she had no choice. \"May the gods forgive us, then. We', 'will ride at once.\"', \"There was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck's spotted gelding, who looked\", 'strong enough to last another three or four days at least. He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up', 'and said, \"I\\'ll take that dirk now, dwarf.\"', '\"Let him keep it.\" Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. \"And see that he has his axe back as well.', 'We may have need of it if we are attacked again.\"', '\"You have my thanks, lady,\" Tyrion said, mounting up.', '\"Save them,\" she said curtly. \"I trust you no more than I did before.\" She was gone before he could', 'frame a reply.', 'Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how he had begun the', 'journey, with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head, and decided that this was a definite', 'improvement. Lady Stark could keep her trust; so long as he could keep the axe, he would count himself', 'ahead in the game.', 'Ser Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a', 'shadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode. The singer had', 'broken several ribs, his woodharp, and all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an', 'Page 224', '', 'utter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by', 'stripes of white. He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say.', 'They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile, and later the', 'wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind. Marillion grew visibly pale.', 'Tyrion trotted up beside him. \"Craven, \" he said, \"rhymes nicely with raven.\" He kicked his horse and', 'moved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and Catelyn Stark.', 'She looked at him, lips pressed tightly together.', '\"As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,\" Tyrion began, \"there is a serious flaw in', \"Littlefinger's fable. Whatever you may believe of me, Lady Stark, I promise you this-1 never bet against\", 'my family.\"', 'ARYA', 'The one-eared black tom arched his back and hissed at her.', 'Arya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls of her bare feet, listening to the flutter of her', 'heart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself, light as a feather. The tomcat', 'watched her come, his eyes wary.', 'Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were', \"scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook's huge fat kitchen cat\", \"had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. When she'd run to him with her\", 'hands bleeding, he had said, \"So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than', 'scratches.\" He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip', 'to keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats.', 'The Red Keep was full of cats: lazy old cats dozing in the sun, coldeyed mousers twitching their tails,', \"quick little kittens with claws like needles, ladies' cats all combed and trusting, ragged shadows prowling\", 'the midden heaps. One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them', 'proudly to Syrio Forel . . . all but this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. \"That\\'s the real king of', 'this castle right there,\" one of the gold cloaks had told her. \"Older than sin and twice as mean. One time,', 'the king was feasting the', \"queen's father, and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of\", 'Lord Tywin\\'s fingers. Robert laughed so hard he like to burst. You stay away from that one, child.\"', 'He had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across the inner bailey,', 'through the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks', \"of the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over Traitor's\", 'Walk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until', \"Arya didn't know where she was.\", 'Page 225', '', 'Now at last she had him. High walls pressed close on either side, and ahead was a blank windowless', 'mass of stone. Quiet as a shadow, she repeated, sliding forward, light as a feather.', 'When she was three steps away from him, the tomcat bolted. Left, then right, he went; and right, then', 'left, went Arya, cutting off his escape. He hissed again and tried to dart between her legs. Quick as a', 'snake, she thought. Her hands closed around him. She hugged him to her chest, whirling and laughing', 'aloud as his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the', 'eyes, and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face. The tomcat', 'yowled and spit.', '\"What\\'s he doing to that cat?\"', 'Startled, Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice. The torn bounded off in the blink of an', 'eye. At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls, dressed as pretty as a doll in blue', 'satin. Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his', 'doublet and a miniature sword at his belt. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa', 'as large as a draft horse hovered over them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister', 'house guards.', '\"What were you doing to that cat, boy?\" Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother she said, \"He\\'s a', 'ragged boy, isn\\'t he? Look at him.\" She giggled.', '\"A ragged dirty smelly boy,\" Tommen agreed.', \"They don't know me, Arya realized. They don't even know I'm a girl. Small wonder; she was barefoot\", 'and dirty, her hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and', \"brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees. You don't wear skirts and silks when you're\", \"catching cats. Quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee. Maybe they wouldn't recognize\", 'her. If they did, she would never hear the end of it. Septa Mordane', 'would be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to her again from the shame.', 'The old fat septa moved forward. \"Boy, how did you come here? You have no business in this part of', 'the castle.\"', '\"You can\\'t keep this sort out,\" one of the red cloaks said. \"Like trying to keep out rats.\"', '\"Who do you belong to, boy?\" the septa demanded. \"Answer me. What\\'s wrong with you, are you', 'mute?\"', \"Arya's voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know her for certain.\", '\"Godwyn, bring him here,\" the septa said. The taller of the guardsmen started down the alley.', \"Panic gripped her throat like a giant's hand. Arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it. Calm\", 'as still water, she mouthed silently.', 'As Godwyn reached for her, Arya moved. Quick as a snake. She leaned to her left, letting his fingers', 'brush her arm, spinning around him, Smooth as summer silk. By the time he got himself turned, she was', 'Page 226', '', 'sprinting down the alley. Swift as a deer. The septa was screeching at her. Arya slid between legs as', 'thick and white as marble columns, bounded to her feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over', 'him when he sat down hard and said \"Oof, \" spun away from the second guard, and then she was past', 'them all, running full out.', 'She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind her. She dropped and rolled. The red cloak', 'went careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to her feet. She saw a window above her, high and', 'narrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her', 'breath as she wriggled through. Slippery as an eel. Dropping to the floor in front of a startled', 'scrubwoman, she hopped up, brushed the rushes off her clothes, and was off again, out the door and', 'along a long hall, down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a', 'low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar. The sounds grew more and more distant behind her.', 'Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they had recognized her, but', \"she didn't think they had. She'd moved too fast. Swift as a deer.\", 'She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit, but the only sound', 'was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself. She', \"wondered where she was. When they had first come to King's Landing, she used to have bad dreams\", 'about getting lost in the castle.', 'Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, an', 'endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her. She would find herself', 'wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending endless circular stairs, darting through', 'courtyards or over bridges, her shouts echoing unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone walls', \"would seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. Sometimes she would hear her father's\", 'voice, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and', 'fainter, until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark.', 'It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered.', 'She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. By then it would be safe for her to come creeping', 'back out and find her way home.', 'By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the', 'blackness. Slowly the shapes around her took on form. Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through', 'the gloom, and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth. She had lost the count. She closed her', 'eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away. When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. Would', 'never have been. She pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark, whispering in her ear. Calm as still', 'water, she told herself. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. She opened her eyes again.', 'The monsters were still there, but the fear was gone.', 'Arya got to her feet, moving warily. The heads were all around her. She touched one, curious,', 'wondering if it was real. Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw. It felt real enough. The bone was smooth', 'beneath her hand, cold and hard to the touch. She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a', 'dagger made of darkness. It made her shiver.', '\"It\\'s dead,\" she said aloud. \"It\\'s just a skull, it can\\'t hurt me.\" Yet somehow the monster seemed to know', 'she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom, and there was something in', 'Page 227', '', 'that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. She edged away from the skull and backed into a', 'second, larger than the first. For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted', 'a bite of her flesh. Arya whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin, and then', 'she was running. Another skull loomed ahead, the biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even slow. She', 'leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw herself against', 'the door.', 'Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The door resisted a moment,', 'before it slowly began to swing', 'inward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city. She opened the', 'door just far enough to slip through, into the hallway beyond.', 'If the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells. Calm as still', 'water, Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothing to see', 'but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face,', 'felt the air move, saw nothing. She was blind. A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded', 'herself. She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out', 'with her hands.', 'Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left. She followed the wall, her hand skimming', 'along the surface, taking small gliding steps through the darkness. All halls lead somewhere. \"ere there is', 'a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya would not be afraid. It seemed as if she', 'had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek.', 'Loose hairs stirred faintly against her skin.', 'From somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the distant sound of voices. A', 'flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black', 'well, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth. Huge stones had been set into the curving', 'walls as steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of. And', 'something was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of the earth . . .', 'Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far below, she saw the light of a', 'single torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, she made out. Their shadows writhed against the', 'sides of the well, tall as giants.

A day, two days, a fortnight . . .\"', '\"And when he learns the truth, what will he do?\" a second voice asked in the liquid accents of the Free', 'Cities.', '\"The gods alone know,\" the first voice said.

She held', 'her breath as the men reached the top of the steps.', '\"What would you have me do?\" asked the torchbearer, a stout man in a leather half cape. Even in heavy', 'boots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground. A round scarred face and a stubble of dark', 'beard showed under his steel cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his', 'belt.

Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a', 'water dancer might.

Every finger wore a ring; some had two.', '\"Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,\" the scarred man said as they stepped out into the', 'hall.

Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, they did', 'not see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet away.', '\"Perhaps so,\" the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the long climb. \"Nonetheless,', 'we must have time. The princess is with child. The khal will not bestir himself until his son is born. You', 'know how they are, these savages.\"', 'The man with the torch pushed at something. Arya heard a deep rumbling. A huge slab of rock, red in', 'the torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that almost made her cry out. Where', 'the entry to the well had been was nothing but stone, solid and unbroken.', '\"If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,\" the stout man in the steel cap said. \"This is no', 'longer a game for two players, if ever it was. Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my', 'reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them.

Sometimes she felt as though her heart had', 'turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, and she could not even find it in her to weep', 'for them. Even their names were fading. \"The clansmen harried us day and night. We lost three men in the', \"first attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister's serving man died of a fever when his wounds\", 'festered.

Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight.', '\"The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,\" Ser Donnel said. He was a stocky youth of twenty', 'years, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair. \"If it were up to me, I', 'would take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some', 'sharp lessons, but your sister has', \"forbidden it.

I meant no offense.\"', '\"Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.\" Catelyn knew what her sister feared. Not shadows,', 'Lannisters, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn. The two of them', 'had grown thick as thieves since Chiggen had died. The little man was more cunning than she liked.', 'When they had entered the mountains, he had been her captive, bound and helpless. What was he now?', 'Her captive still, yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle, wearing', \"the shadowskin cloak he'd won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he'd taken off Chiggen's\", 'Page 239', '', 'corpse. Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in', \"service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn's young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear. Could I be\", 'wrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the first time. Could he be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn', 'and all the rest? And if he was, what did that make her? Six men had died to bring him here.', 'Resolute, she pushed her doubts away. \"When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could', 'send for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds.\" More than once she had', 'feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey. Toward the end he could scarcely sit his', 'horse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied', 'him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him.', 'Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered. \"The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the', 'Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,\" he said. \"We have a septon at the gate who tends to our', 'wounded. He can see to your man\\'s hurts.\"', \"Catelyn had more faith in a maester's learning than a septon's prayers. She was about to say as much\", 'when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either', 'side of them. Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast,', 'twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that', 'arched above the road. Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge. When', 'they had climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were', 'grey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and', 'obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. \"Who would pass the Bloody Gate?\" he called.', '\"Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,\" the young knight answered.', 'The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. \"I thought the lady looked familiar. You are far from home, little', 'Cat.\"', '\"And you, Uncle,\" she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice', 'again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood.', '\"My home is at my back,\" he said gruffly.', '\"Your home is in my heart,\" Catelyn told him. \"Take off your helm. I would look on your face again.\"', '\"The years have not improved it, I fear,\" Brynden Tully said, but when he lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw', 'that he lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left', 'him only grey, but the smile was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in', 'his deep blue eyes. \"Did Lysa know you were coming?\"', '\"There was no time to send word ahead,\" Catelyn told him. The others were coming up behind her. \"I', 'fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.\"', '\"May we enter the Vale?\" Ser Donnel asked.

Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she knew; the sellsword', 'was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his sword had helped cut them through to safety.', 'Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in', 'him, and little loyalty.

Beyond', 'was dense forest of pine and spruce, and the mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there,', 'chiseled deep into the rock, ascending into the sky. \"Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,\"', 'Mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. \"When they get frightened or dizzy,', 'sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight.

If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all, it would be on the', 'wrong side of the sheet.', 'The ascent was easier than Catelyn had dared hope. The trees pressed close, leaning over the path to', 'make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it seemed as though they were moving up a', 'long black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed', 'with night-eyes. They plodded upward, winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain', 'as the steps twisted and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their', 'mules made only the softest sound on the rock.

Before long she was fighting sleep.', 'Perhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them.', '\"Stone,\" Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone', \"walls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The gate swung open at Mya's shout. Inside, the\", 'portly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred', 'meat and onions still hot from the spit.

The hot juices ran down her chin and', 'dripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care.', 'Then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second part of the ascent seemed', 'more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn, and here and there littered with', 'pebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path.', '\"You don\\'t want your mule to break a leg up here,\" she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel', 'the altitude more now. The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts', 'that tugged at her clothing', 'and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she', 'could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no brighter than', 'candles.', 'Snow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low', \"wall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the Giant's Lance in such a way as to command the entire\", 'stone stair above the lower waycastle. An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from', 'Stone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious', 'young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves', 'before his fire, but Mya declined. \"We ought to keep going, my lady,\" she said. \"If it please you.\" Catelyn', 'Page 247', '', 'nodded.', 'Again they were given fresh mules. Hers was white. Mya smiled when she saw him. \"Whitey\\'s a good', 'one, my lady. Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful. He\\'ll kick if he doesn\\'t like you.\"', 'The white mule seemed to like Catelyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods. There was no ice either,', 'and she was grateful for that as well. \"My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the', 'snow began,\" Mya told her. \"It was always white above here, and the ice never melted.\" She shrugged. \"I', \"can't remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the\", 'olden times.\"', 'So young, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that. The girl had lived half her', 'life in summer, and that was all she knew. Winter is coming, child, she wanted to tell her. The words', 'were on her lips; she almost said them. Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last.', 'Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to', 'nothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could', 'almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn', 'found it was better to look up than down. The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze', 'and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat.', 'When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted. \"It\\'s best to lead the', 'mules over,\" she said. \"The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.\"', 'Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty feet long and close to', 'three feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to either side. She could hear the wind shrieking. Mya', 'stepped lightly out, her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing', 'a bailey. It was her turn. Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its', 'jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her. She stopped,', 'trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over', 'the edge. Catelyn edged her foot backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and', 'she could not retreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her', 'back.', '\"Lady Stark,\" Mya called across the gulf. The girl sounded a thousand leagues away. \"Are you well?\"', 'Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride. \"I . . . I cannot do this, child,\" she called out.', '\"Yes you can,\" the bastard girl said. \"I know you can. Look how wide the path is.\"', '\"I don\\'t want to look.\" The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain and sky and mules,', \"whirling like a child's top. Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing.\", '\"I\\'ll come back for you,\" Mya said. \"Don\\'t move, my lady.\"', 'Moving was about the last thing Catelyn was about to do. She listened to the skirling of the wind and the', 'scuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was there, taking her gently by the arm. \"Keep your eyes', \"closed if you like. Let go of the rope now, Whitey will take care of himself. Very good, my lady. I'll lead\", \"you over, it's easy, you'll see. Give me a step now. That's it, move your foot, just slide it forward. See.\", 'Page 248', '', 'Now another. Easy. You could run across. Another one, go on. Yes.\" And so, foot by foot, step by', 'step, the bastard girl led Catelyn across, blind and trembling, while the white mule followed placidly', 'behind them.', 'The waycastle called Sky was no more than a high, crescent-shaped wall of unmortared stone raised', 'against the side of the mountain, but even the topless towers of Valyria could not have looked more', \"beautiful to Catelyn Stark. Here at last the snow crown began; Sky's weathered stones were rimed with\", 'frost, and long spears of ice hung from the slopes above.', 'Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates opened before', 'them. Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones of all', 'sizes. No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here. A mouth', 'yawned in the rock face in front of them. \"The stables and barracks are in there,\" Mya said. \"The last part', \"is inside the mountain. It can be a little dark, but at least you're out of the wind. This is as far as the mules\", \"can go. Past here, well, it's a sort of\", \"chimney, more like a stone ladder than proper steps, but it's not too bad. Another hour and we'll be\", 'there.\"', 'Catelyn looked up. Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the foundations of the Eyrie.', 'It could not be more than six hundred feet above them. From below it looked like a small white', 'honeycomb. She remembered what her uncle had said of baskets and winches. \"The Lannisters may', 'have their pride,\" she told Mya, \"but the Tullys are born with better sense. I have ridden all day and the', 'best part of a night. Tell them to lower a basket. I shall ride with the turnips.\"', 'The sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the Eyrie. A stocky,', 'silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the', \"basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn's household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon,\", 'thin and nervous, with too little hair and too much neck. \"Lady Stark,\" Ser Vardis said, \"the pleasure is as', 'great as it is unanticipated.\" Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement. \"Indeed it is, my lady,', 'indeed it is. I have sent word to your sister. She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.\"', '\"I hope she had a good night\\'s rest,\" Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go', 'unnoticed.', 'The men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair. The Eyrie was a small castle by the', 'standards of the great houses; seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a', 'shoulder of the great mountain. It had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels, but Ned said its', \"granary was as large as Winterfell's, and its towers could house five hundred men. Yet it seemed\", 'strangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed through it, its pale stone halls echoing and empty.', 'Lysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her long auburn hair tumbled unbound', \"across bare white shoulders and down her back. A maid stood behind her, brushing out the night's\", 'tangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sister rose to her feet, smiling. \"Cat,\" she said. \"Oh, Cat, how', 'good it is to see you. My sweet sister.\" She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms.', '\"How long it has been,\" Lysa murmured against her. \"Oh, how very very long.\"', 'It had been five years, in truth; five cruel years, for Lysa. They had taken their toll. Her sister was two', 'years the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than Catelyn, Lysa had grown thick of body, pale', 'Page 249', '', 'and puffy of face. She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but hers were pale and watery, never still. Her', 'small mouth had turned petulant. As', \"Catelyn held her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who'd waited beside her that day in the\", \"sept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of hope she had been. All that remained of her sister's beauty was\", 'the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist.', '\"You look well,\" Catelyn lied, \"but . . . tired.\"', 'Her sister broke the embrace. \"Tired. Yes. Oh, yes.\" She seemed to notice the others then; her maid,', 'Maester Colemon, Ser Vardis. \"Leave us,\" she told them. \"I wish to speak to my sister alone.\" She held', \"Catelyn's hand as they withdrew . . .\", '. . . and dropped it the instant the door closed. Catelyn saw her face change. It was as if the sun had', 'gone behind a cloud. \"Have you taken leave of your senses?\" Lysa snapped at her. \"To bring him here,', 'without a word of permission, without so much as a warning, to drag us into your quarrels with the', 'Lannisters . . .\"', '\"My quarrels?\" Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing.

Gods, Cat, do you know', 'what you\\'ve done?\"', '\"Mother?\" a small voice said. Lysa whirled, her heavy robe swirling around her. Robert Arryn, Lord of', 'the Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes. He', 'was a painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his days, and from time to time he trembled.

Ned thinks it may come to war.\"', '\"Quiet!\" Lysa snapped at her. \"You\\'re scaring the boy.\" Little Robert took a quick peek over his', 'shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and he pressed himself against his', 'mother. \"Don\\'t be afraid, my sweet baby,\" Lysa whispered. \"Mother\\'s here, nothing will hurt you.\" She', 'opened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly,', 'buried his face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa stroked his hair.', \"Catelyn was at a loss for words. Jon Anyn's son, she thought incredulously. She remembered her own\", 'baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times as fierce. Small wonder the lords of', 'the Vale were restive. For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away', 'from his mother to foster with the Lannisters . . .', '\"We\\'re safe here,\" Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn was not sure.', '\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. \"No one is safe.

Those, Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the', 'Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.', '\"So many,\" she said as her silver stepped slowly onward, \"and from so many lands.\"', 'Viserys was less impressed. \"The trash of dead cities,\" he sneered. He was careful to speak in the', 'Common Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet even so Dany found herself glancing back', 'at the men of her khas, to make certain he had not been overheard. He went on blithely. \"All these', 'savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built . . . and kill.\" He laughed. \"They do', 'know how to kill. Otherwise I\\'d have no use for them at all.\"', '\"They are my people now,\" Dany said. \"You should not call them savages, brother.\"', '\"The dragon speaks as he likes,\" Viserys said . . . in the Common Tongue. He glanced over his shoulder', 'at Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored them with a mocking smile. \"See, the savages', 'lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men.\" A mosseaten stone monolith loomed over the', 'road, fifty feet tall.

You do not demand a gift, not of a', 'khaL You do not demand anything of a khal.\"', '\"It is not right to make him wait.\" Dany did not know why she was defending her brother, yet she was.', '\"Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers.\"', 'Ser Jorah snorted. \"Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms.\"', 'Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone. \"What . . . what if it were not Viserys?\" she', 'asked. \"If it were someone else who led them? Someone stronger?

In the Free Cities of the west, towers and manses and hovels and bridges', 'and shops and halls all crowded in on one another, but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously, baking in', 'the warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and empty.', 'Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes. She saw carved stone pavilions, manses of woven grass', 'as large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids faced with marble, log halls open to the', 'sky. In place of walls, some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges. \"None of them are alike,\" she', 'said.', '\"Your brother had part of the truth,\" Ser Jorah admitted. \"The Dothraki do not build. A thousand years', 'ago, to make a house, they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof. The', \"buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they've plundered, and they built each\", 'after the fashion of their own peoples.\"', 'Most of the halls, even the largest, seemed deserted. \"Where are the people who live here?\" Dany', 'asked. The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting, but elsewhere she had seen only a', 'few eunuchs going about their business.', '\"Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and their slaves and', 'servants,\" Ser Jorah replied, \"yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar,', 'should all the khals return to the Mother at once. The crones have prophesied that one day that will come', 'to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children.\"', 'Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti and Asshai and', 'the Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of Mountains looming overhead. Dany smiled as she', \"recalled Magister Illyrio's slave girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid\", 'silver. The \"palace\" was a cavernous wooden feasting hall, its rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet,', 'its roof sewn silk, a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains, or lowered to admit', 'the endless sky. Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges, firepits, and', 'hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills, covered with grass.', \"A small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo's arrival. As each rider swung down\", 'from his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried', 'as well. Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt.

At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki Kingsguard,', 'sworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more', 'than a guard; they were the khal\\'s brothers, his shadows, his fiercest friends. \"Blood of my blood,\" Drogo', 'called them, and so it was; they shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded', 'that when the khal died, his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died', 'at the hands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him joyfully', \"into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal's wine, his tent, and even\", \"his wives, though never his horses. A man's mount was his own.\", 'Daenerys was glad that Khal Drogo did not hold to those ancient ways. She should not have liked being', 'shared.

At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat', 'strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but for the past fortnight he', 'had been riding her on his own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with every circuit.', 'They passed beneath the gatehouse, over the drawbridge, through', 'the outer walls. Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them, sniffing at the wind. Close behind', 'came Theon Greyjoy, with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads; he had a mind to take a deer, he', 'had told them. He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs, and Joseth, a stick-thin', 'stableman whom Robb had named master of horse while Hullen was away. Maester Luwin brought up', 'the rear, riding on a donkey. Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone, just the', 'two of them, but Hal Mollen would not hear of it, and Maester Luwin backed him. If Bran fell off his', 'horse or injured himself, the maester was determined to be with him.', 'Beyond the castle lay the market square, its wooden stalls deserted now. They rode down the muddy', 'streets of the village, past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone.

Winter is coming.', 'A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one man dropped the wood', 'he was carrying as he shrank away in fear, but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight.

It felt almost as good as flying.', '\"I\\'d race you, but I fear you\\'d win.\" Robb\\'s tone was light and joking, yet Bran could tell that something', 'was troubling his brother underneath the smile.', '\"I don\\'t want to race.\" Bran looked around for the direwolves. Both had vanished into the wood. \"Did', 'you hear Summer howling last night?\"', '\"Grey Wind was restless too,\" Robb said. His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt, and a', 'reddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his fifteen years. \"Sometimes I think they', 'know things . . . sense things . . .\" Robb sighed. \"I never know how much to tell you, Bran. I wish you', 'were older.\"', '\"I\\'m eight now!\" Bran said. \"Eight isn\\'t so much younger than fifteen, and I\\'m the heir to Winterfell, after', 'you.\"', '\"So you are.\" Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared. \"Bran, I need to tell you something. There', 'was a bird last night. From King\\'s Landing. Maester Luwin woke me.\"', 'Bran felt a sudden dread. Dark wings, dark words, Old Nan always said, and of late the messenger', 'ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb wrote to the Lord Commander of the', \"Night's Watch, the bird that came back brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing. Then a\", 'message had arrived from the Eyrie, from Mother, but that had not been good news either. She did not', 'say when she meant to return, only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort of liked the little', 'man, yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine. There was something about the', 'Lannisters,', 'Page 264', '', 'something he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched', 'hard as a stone. Robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin, Theon', \"Greyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward, riders were sent out on fast horses, carrying Robb's commands\", 'throughout the north. Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin, the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the', 'top of the Neck. No one ever told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good.', 'And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. \"Was the bird from Mother? Is she', 'coming home?\"', '\"The message was from Alyn in King\\'s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And Wyl and Heward as well.', 'Murdered by the Kingslayer.\" Robb lifted his face to the snow, and the flakes melted on his cheeks.', '\"May the gods give them rest.\"', \"Bran did not know what to say. He felt as if he'd been punched. Jory had been captain of the household\", 'guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born. \"They killed Jory?\" He remembered all the times Jory', 'had chased him over the roofs. He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate, or sitting', 'at his accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall, joking as he ate. \"Why would anyone kill Jory?\"', 'Robb shook his head numbly, the pain plain in his eyes. \"I don\\'t know, and . . .

He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then, and went on in', 'the solemn voice of Robb the Lord. \"Bran, I promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this be', 'forgotten.\"', 'Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful. \"What will you do?\" he asked as Theon Greyjoy', 'reined in beside them.', '\"Theon thinks I should call the banners,\" Robb said.', '\"Blood for blood.\" For once Greyjoy did not smile. His lean, dark face had a hungry look to it, and', 'black hair fell down across his eyes.', '\"Only the lord can call the banners,\" Bran said as the snow drifted down around them.', '\"If your father dies,\" Theon said, \"Robb will be Lord of Winterfell.\"', '\"He won\\'t die!\" Bran screamed at him.', 'Robb took his hand. \"He won\\'t die, not Father,\" he said calmly.', '\"Still ... the honor of the north is in my hands now. When our lord father took his leave of us, he told me', 'to be strong for you and for Rickon. I\\'m almost a man grown, Bran.\"', 'Bran shivered. \"I wish Mother was back,\" he said miserably. He looked around for Maester Luwin; his', 'donkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a rise. \"Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners', 'Page 265', '', 'too?\"', '\"The maester is timid as an old woman,\" said Theon.', '\"Father always listened to his counsel,\" Bran reminded his brother. \"Mother too.\"', '\"I listen to him,\" Robb insisted. \"I listen to everyone.\"', 'The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes on his face. Not so long', 'ago, the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement,', 'but now he felt only dread. \"Can we go back now?\" he asked. \"I\\'m cold.\"', 'Robb glanced around. \"We need to find the wolves. Can you stand to go a bit longer?\"', '\"I can go as long as you can.\" Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short, for fear of saddle', 'sores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother. He was sick of the way everyone', 'was always fussing over him and asking how he was.', '\"Let\\'s hunt down the hunters, then,\" Robb said. Side by side, they urged their mounts off the kingsroad', 'and struck out into the wolfswood. Theon dropped back and followed well behind them, talking and', 'joking with the guardsmen.', 'It was nice under the trees. Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins lightly and looking all around', 'him as they went. He knew this wood, but he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as', 'though he were seeing it for the first time. The smells filled his nostrils; the sharp fresh tang of pine', 'needles, the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves, the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires. He', 'caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak, and paused', 'to study the silvery web of an empress spider.', 'Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no longer hear their voices. From', 'ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters. It grew louder until they reached the stream.

He tied his horse to a tree on the far side,', 'and waded back across for Bran and Dancer. The current foamed around rock and root, and Bran could', 'feel the spray on his face as Robb led him over. It made him smile. For a moment he felt strong again,', 'Page 266', '', 'and whole. He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them, right up to the very top, with the', 'whole forest spread out beneath him.', 'They were on the far side when they heard the howl, a long rising wail that moved through the trees like', 'a cold wind. Bran raised his head to listen. \"Summer,\" he said.

As he waited, he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel his legs, hanging', 'useless in the stirrups, but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing, and the melting snow had', 'soaked through his gloves to chill his hands. He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin', 'and Joseth and the rest.', 'When he heard the rustle of leaves, Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn, expecting to see his', 'friends, but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers.', '\"Good day to you,\" he said nervously. One look, and Bran knew they were neither foresters nor', 'farmers. He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed. His surcoat was new, dark grey wool', 'with silver buttons, and a heavy silver pin fastened his fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders. His boots and', 'gloves were lined with fur as well.', '\"All alone, are you?\" said the biggest of them, a bald man with a raw windburnt face. \"Lost in the', 'wolfswood, poor lad.\"', '\"I\\'m not lost.\" Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking', 'at him. He counted four, but when he turned his head, he saw two others behind him. \"My brother rode', 'off just a moment ago, and my guard will be here shortly.\"', '\"Your guard, is it?\" a second man said. Grey stubble covered his gaunt face. \"And what would they be', 'guarding, my little lord? Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak?\"', '\"Pretty,\" said a woman\\'s voice. She scarcely looked like a woman; tall and lean, with the same hard face', 'as the others, her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm.

He held out his hand.', '\"We\\'ll take the horse too,\" said another of them, a woman shorter than Robb, with a broad fiat face and', 'lank yellow hair. \"Get down, and be quick about it.\" A knife slid from her sleeve into her hand, its edge', 'jagged as a saw.', '\"No,\" Bran blurted. \"I can\\'t', 'The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off. \"You', 'can, lordling . . . and will, if you know what\\'s good for you.\"', '\"Stiv, look how he\\'s strapped on.\" The tall woman pointed with her spear. \"Might be it\\'s the truth he\\'s', 'telling.\"', '\"Straps, is it?\" Stiv said.

More fool you. Think the', 'white walkers will care if you have a hostage?\" He turned back to Bran and slashed at the strap around', 'his thigh. The leather parted with a sigh.', 'The stroke had been quick and careless, biting deep. Looking down, Bran glimpsed pale flesh where the', 'wool of his leggings had parted. Then the blood began to flow. He watched the red stain spread, feeling', 'light-headed, curiously apart; there had been no pain, not even a hint of feeling. The big man grunted in', 'surprise.', '\"Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death,\" Robb called out.', 'Bran looked up in desperate hope, and there he was. The strength of the words were undercut by the', 'way his voice cracked with strain.

We'll thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison, and you and your\", 'brother can be on your way.\"', 'Robb whistled. They heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet leaves. The undergrowth parted,', 'low-hanging branches giving up their accumulation of snow, and Grey Wind and Summer emerged from', 'the green. Summer sniffed the air and growled.', '\"Wolves,\" gasped Hali.', '\"Direwolves,\" Bran said. Still half-grown, they were as large as any wolf he had ever seen, but the', 'differences were easy to spot, if you knew what to look for. Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster', 'had taught him. A direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body, and its snout and', 'jaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrible about them as', \"they stood there amid the gently falling snow. Fresh blood spotted Grey Wind's muzzle.\", '\"Dogs,\" the big bald man said contemptuously. \"Yet I\\'m told there\\'s nothing like a wolfskin cloak to', 'warm a man by night.\" He made a sharp gesture. \"Take them.\"', 'Robb shouted, \"Winterfell!\" and kicked his horse. The gelding', 'plunged down the bank as the ragged men closed. A man with an axe rushed in, shouting and heedless.', \"Robb's sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood. The man\", 'with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins, and for half a second he had them . . . and then', 'Grey Wind was on him, bearing him down. He fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout, flailing', 'wildly with his knife as his head went under. The direwolf plunged in after him, and the white water turned', 'red where they had vanished.', 'Robb and Osha matched blows in midstream. Her long spear was a steel-headed serpent, flashing out at', 'his chest, once, twice, three times, but Robb parried every thrust with his longsword, turning the point', 'aside. On the fourth or fifth thrust, the tall woman overextended herself and lost her balance, just for a', 'second. Robb charged, riding her down.', 'A few feet away, Summer darted in and snapped at Hali. The knife bit at his flank. Summer slid away,', 'snarling, and came rushing in again. This time his jaws closed around her calf. Holding the knife with both', 'hands, the small woman stabbed down, but the direwolf seemed to sense the blade coming. He pulled', 'free for an instant, his mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh. When Hali stumbled and fell, he', 'came at her again, slamming her backward, teeth tearing at her belly.', 'The sixth man ran from the carnage . . . but not far. As he went scrambling up the far side of the bank,', 'Grey Wind emerged from the stream, dripping wet. He shook the water off and bounded after the', 'running man, hamstringing him with a single snap of his teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming', 'man slid back down toward the water.', \"And then there was no one left but the big man, Stiv. He slashed at Bran's chest strap, grabbed his arm,\", 'and yanked. Suddenly Bran was falling. He sprawled on the ground, his legs tangled under him, one foot', 'Page 269', '', 'in the stream. He could not feel the cold of the water, but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to', 'his throat. \"Back away,\" the man warned, \"or I\\'ll open the boy\\'s windpipe, I swear it.\"', 'Robb reined his horse in, breathing hard. The fury went out of his eyes, and his sword arm dropped.', 'In that moment Bran saw everything. Summer was savaging Hali, pulling glistening blue snakes from her', 'belly. Her eyes were wide and staring. Bran could not tell whether she was alive or dead.

Grey Wind padded toward her, dripping wet. \"Call him off!\" the big man shouted. \"Call', 'them both off, or the cripple boy dies now!\"', '\"Grey Wind, Summer, to me,\" Robb said.', 'The direwolves stopped, turned their heads. Grey Wind loped back to Robb. Summer stayed where he', 'was, his eyes on Bran and the man beside him. He growled. His muzzle was wet and red, but his eyes', 'burned.', 'Osha used the butt end of her spear to lever herself back to her feet. Blood leaked from a wound on the', \"upper arm where Robb had cut her.

His hand trembled; Bran felt a trickle of blood where the knife pressed', 'against his neck. The stench of the man filled his nose; he smelled of fear. \"You,\" he called out to Robb.', '\"You have a name?\"', '\"I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell.\"', '\"This is your brother?\"', '\"Yes.,,', '\"You want him alive, you do what I say. Off the horse.\"', 'Robb hesitated a moment. Then, slowly and deliberately, he dismounted and stood with his sword in', 'hand.', '\"Now kill the wolves.\"', 'Robb did not move.', '\"You do it. The wolves or the boy.\"', '\"No!\" Bran screamed. If Robb did as they asked, Stiv would kill them both anyway, once the', 'direwolves were dead.', 'The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till Bran sobbed in pain. \"You', 'Page 270', '', 'shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?\" He twisted harder. \"You hear me?\"', 'A low thrum came from the woods behind them. Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped', 'broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest.

They eyed', \"the wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to Hali's corpse to feed, Joseth dropped his knife\", 'and scrambled for the bush, heaving. Even Maester Luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind', 'a tree, but only for an instant.

Theon Greyjoy stood beside a', 'sentinel tree, his bow in hand. He was smiling. Ever smiling. A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft', 'ground at his feet, but it had taken only one. \"A dead enemy is a thing of beauty,\" he announced.', '\"Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy,\" Robb said loudly. \"I ought to chain you up in the yard and', 'let Bran take a few practice shots at you. \"', '\"You should be thanking me for saving your brother\\'s life.\"', '\"What if you had missed the shot?\" Robb said. \"What if you\\'d only wounded him?

What would have happened to my brother then? Did you ever', 'think of that, Greyjoy?\"', \"Theon's smile was gone. He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the ground, one by\", 'one.', 'Robb glared at his guardsmen. \"Where were you?\" he demanded of them. \"I was sure you were close', 'behind us.\"', 'The men traded unhappy glances. \"We were following, m\\'lord,\" said Quent, the youngest of them, his', 'beard a soft brown fuzz. \"Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass, begging your pardons, and', 'then, well, as it were He glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed.', '\"I spied a turkey,\" Theon said, annoyed by the question. \"How was I to know that you\\'d leave the boy', 'alone?\"', 'Robb turned his head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen him so angry, yet he said', 'Page 271', '', 'nothing. Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin. \"How badly is my brother wounded?\"', '\"No more than a scratch,\" the maester said.

His chances of overpowering Mord were small to none,', 'and no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-long rope, so he would have to talk himself', 'free. His mouth had gotten him into this cell; it could damn well get him out.', 'Tyrion pushed himself to his feet, doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath him, with its', 'ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge.

It caught', 'Tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees, wimpering. He forced himself to look up at the gaoler.', '\"As rich as the Lannisters,\" he wheezed. \"That\\'s what they say, Mord-\"', 'Mord grunted. The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face. The pain was so', 'bad he did not remember', 'falling, but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell. His ear was ringing, and his', 'mouth was full of blood. He groped for purchase, to push himself up, and his fingers brushed against . . .', 'nothing. Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded, and tried his best to stop', 'breathing. He had fallen right on the edge, inches from the blue.', '\"More to say?\" Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull. The snap made Tyrion', 'jump. The turnkey laughed.', \"He won'tpush me over, Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge. Catelyn\", \"Stark wants me alive, he doesn't dare kill me.

Fortunately, Mord was one of the latter. The turnkey lowered the strap. \"Writing down gold.', 'Much gold.\"', '\"Oh, much gold,\" Tyrion assured him. \"The purse is just a taste, my friend.

When', 'the letter was written, the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously. \"Now deliver my message,\" Tyrion urged.', 'He was shivering in his sleep when they came for him, late that night.

You recall.\"', '\"Get him the damnable cloak,\" Ser Vardis said.', 'Mord did not dare grumble. He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution, yet he went for the', 'Page 278', '', 'cloak. When he draped it around his prisoner\\'s neck, Tyrion smiled. \"My thanks. I shall think of you', 'whenever I wear it.\" He flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder, and felt warm for the', 'first time in days. \"Lead on, Ser Vardis.\"', 'The High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches, burning in the sconces along the', 'walls. The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn on her breast in pearls. Since she', \"did not look the sort to join the Night's Watch, Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning\", 'clothes were appropriate garb for a confession. Her long auburn hair, woven into an elaborate braid, fell', 'across her left shoulder. The taller throne beside her was', 'empty; no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in his sleep. Tyrion was thankful for that', 'much, at least.', 'He bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall. Lady Arryn had summoned her knights', \"and retainers to hear his confession, as he had hoped. He saw Ser Brynden Tully's craggy face and Lord\", \"Nestor Royce's bluff one. Beside Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black side-whiskers who\", 'could only be his heir, Ser Albar. Most of the principal houses of the Vale were represented. Tyrion', 'noted Ser Lyn Corbray, slender as a sword, Lord Hunter with his gouty legs, the widowed Lady', 'Waynwood surrounded by her sons. Others sported sigils he did not know; broken lance, green viper,', 'burning tower, winged chalice.', 'Among the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high road; Ser Rodrik Cassel,', 'pale from half-healed wounds, stood with Ser Willis Wode beside him. Marillion the singer had found a', 'new woodharp. Tyrion smiled; whatever happened here tonight, he did not wish it to happen in secret,', 'and there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far.', \"In the rear of the hall, Bronn lounged beneath a pillar.

Tyrion gave him a long look, wondering . . .', 'Catelyn Stark spoke first. \"You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.\"', '\"I do, my lady,\" Tyrion answered.', 'Lysa Arryn smiled at her sister. \"The sky cells always break them. The gods can see them there, and', 'there is no darkness to hide in.\"', '\"He does not look broken to me,\" Lady Catelyn said.', 'Lady Lysa paid her no mind. \"Say what you will,\" she commanded Tyrion.', 'And now to roll the dice, he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn. \"Where to begin? I am a', 'vile little man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting, my lords and ladies. I have lain with', 'whores, not once but hundreds of times. I have wished my own lord father dead, and my sister, our', 'gracious queen, as well.\" Behind him, someone chuckled. \"I have not always treated my servants with', 'kindness. I have gambled. I have even cheated, I blush to admit.

You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into an', 'open cell to freeze and starve.\" He lifted his head, to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had', 'left on his face. \"Where is the king\\'s justice? Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms? I stand', 'accused, you say. Very well. I demand a ttial! Let me speak, and let my truth or falsehood be judged', 'openly, in the sight of gods and men.\"', 'A low murmuring filled the High Hall. He had her, Tyrion knew. He was highborn, the son of the most', 'powerful lord in the realm, the brother of the queen. He could not be denied a trial. Guardsmen in', 'sky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion, but Ser Vardis bid them halt and looked to Lady Lysa.', 'Her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile. \"If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for', \"which you stand accused, then by the king's own laws, you must pay with your life's blood.

A narrow weirwood door stood between two slender marble pillars, a', 'crescent moon carved in the white wood. Those standing closest edged backward as a pair of', 'guardsmen marched through. One man removed the heavy bronze bars; the second pulled the door', 'inward. Their blue cloaks rose snapping from their shoulders, caught in the sudden gust of wind that came', 'howling through the open door. Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky, speckled with cold uncaring', 'stars.', '\"Behold the king\\'s justice,\" Lysa Arryn said. Torch flames fluttered like permons along the walls, and', 'here and there the odd torch guttered out.', '\"Lysa, I think this unwise,\" Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall.', 'Her sister ignored her. \"You want a trial, my lord of Lannister. Very well, a trial you shall have. My son', 'will listen to whatever you care to', 'say, and you shall hear his judgment. Then you may leave ... by one door or the other.\"', 'She looked so pleased with herself, Tyrion thought, and small wonder. How could a trial threaten her,', 'when her weakling son was the lord judge? Tyrion glanced at her Moon Door. Mother, I want to see him', 'fly! the boy had said. How many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already?', 'Page 280', '', '\" I thank you, my good lady, but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert,\" Tyrion said politely. \"The gods', 'know the truth of my innocence. I will have their verdict, not the judgment of men. I demand trial by', 'combat.\"', 'A storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns. Lord Nestor Royce snorted, Ser Willis', 'chuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran', 'down their faces. Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his', 'broken hand. Even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon Door.', 'Lysa Arryn\\'s watery blue eyes looked uncertain. He had caught her off balance. \"You have that right, to', 'be sure.\"', 'The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one', 'knee. \"My lady, I beg the boon of championing your cause.\"', '\"The honor should be mine,\" old Lord Hunter said. \"For the love I bore your lord husband, let me', 'avenge his death.\"', '\"My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,\" Ser Albar Royce boomed. \"Let me', 'serve his son in this.\"', '\"The gods favor the man with the just cause,\" said Ser Lyn Corbray, \"yet often that turns out to be the', 'man with the surest sword. We all know who that is.\" He smiled modestly.', 'A dozen other men all spoke at once, clamoring to be heard. Tyrion found it disheartening to realize so', 'many strangers were eager to kill him. Perhaps this had not been such a clever plan after all.', 'Lady Lysa raised a hand for silence. \"I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if he', 'were among us.

You shall be our champion.\"', 'Ser Vardis had been singularly silent. \"My lady,\" he said gravely, sinking to one knee, \"pray give this', 'burden to another, I have no taste for it.

It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.\"', 'Oh, excellent, Tyrion thought. \"I agree.\"', 'Lysa glared at him. \"You demanded a trial by combat.\"', '\"And now I demand a champion, such as you have chosen for yourself.

The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over', 'his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone. Across his', 'white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser', 'Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.', '\"I looked for you on the Trident,\" Ned said to them.', '\"We were not there,\" Ser Gerold answered.', '\"Woe to the Usurper if we had been,\" said Ser Oswell.', '\"When King\\'s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you', 'were.\"', '\"Far away,\" Ser Gerold said, \"or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn', 'in seven hells.\"', '\"I came down on Storm\\'s End to lift the siege,\" Ned told them, .,and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne', 'dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty.

While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of', 'red squirted Jon in the face. Haider howled in protest at the waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and', 'struggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs.', 'By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat, Samwell Tarly had', 'gone.', 'That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion. When Jon arrived', 'at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire. The older men clapped', 'him on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of', 'garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in', 'butter. \"From the Lord Commander\\'s own table,\" Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of spinach', 'and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.', '\"Do you think they\\'ll keep us together?\" Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily.', 'Toad made a face. \"I hope not. I\\'m sick of looking at those ears of yours.\"', '\"Ho,\" said Pyp. \"Listen to the crow call the raven black. You\\'re certain to be a ranger, Toad.

If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face,', 'and he\\'ll run off screaming.\"', 'Everyone laughed but Grenn. \"I hope I\\'m a ranger.\"', '\"You and everyone else,\" said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man', \"was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night's\", 'Watch. It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through', 'the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting wildlings and giants', 'and monstrous snow bears.', '\"Not everyone,\" said Halder. \"It\\'s the builders for me. What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?\"', 'The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig', 'tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the', 'forest pressed too close to the Wall. Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from', 'frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever', 'higher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from', 'Page 297', '', 'Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they', 'could.', '\"The Old Bear\\'s no fool,\" Dareon observed. \"You\\'re certain to be a builder, and Jon\\'s certain to be a', 'ranger. He\\'s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle was the First before he . . .\" His', 'voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said.', '\"Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,\" Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries. The rest', \"might have given up all hope of his uncle's safe return, but not him. He pushed away the berries, scarcely\", 'touched, and rose from the bench.', '\"Aren\\'t you going to eat those?\" Toad asked.', '\"They\\'re yours.\" Jon had hardly tasted Hobb\\'s great feast. \"I could not eat another bite.\" He took his', 'cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out.', 'Pyp followed him. \"Jon, what is it?\"', '\"Sam,\" he admitted. \"He was not at table tonight.\"', '\"It\\'s not like him to miss a meal,\" Pyp said thoughtfully. \"Do you suppose he\\'s taken ill?\"', '\"He\\'s frightened. We\\'re leaving him.\" He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet', \"farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he'd given her\", 'Needle. \"Once we say our words, we\\'ll all have duties to attend to. Some of us may be sent away, to', 'Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these', \"new boys who are coming up the kingsroad.

The direwolf walked\", 'beside him to the stables. Some of the', 'more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered. Jon saddled his mare,', 'mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of him,', 'flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. Jon let him go. A wolf needed to hunt.', 'He had no destination in mind. He wanted only to ride. He followed the creek for a time, listening to the', 'icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad. It stretched out before him,', 'narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon', \"Snow with a vast longing. Winterfell was down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King's Landing and\", 'the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isles of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the', 'hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria. All the places that Jon would', 'never see. The world was down that road . . . and he was here.', 'Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon. \"I have not', 'Page 298', '', 'sworn yet,\" he muttered. He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes.', 'He had come here freely, and he might leave freely . . . until he said the words. He need only ride on, and', 'he could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his', 'brothers.', 'Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was', \"no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King's Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a\", 'place for him. The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked', 'like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and', 'dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?', 'Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him. The fires of Castle Black were hidden', 'behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to', 'horizon.', 'He wheeled his horse around and started for home.', \"Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander's\", 'Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse. Jon found himself', 'thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he', 'must do.', \"Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and frail, the\", 'maester shared his chambers with two', 'of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties. The brothers joked that', \"he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night's Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at\", 'them. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on his neck', \"the size of a pigeon's egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why he always\", 'seemed so angry.', 'It was Chett who answered Jon\\'s knock. \"I need to speak to Maester Aemon,\" Jon told him.', '\"The maester is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe he\\'ll see you.\" He began', 'to shut the door.', 'Jon jammed it open with his boot. \"I need to speak to him now. The morning will be too late.\"', 'Chett scowled. \"The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do you know how old he', 'is?\"', '\"Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,\" Jon said. \"Give him my pardons. I would not', 'disturb his rest if it were not important.\"', '\"And if I refuse?\"', 'Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door. \"I can stand here all night if I must.\"', 'The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him. \"Wait in the library.', 'Page 299', '', 'There\\'s wood. Start a fire. I won\\'t have the maester catching a chill on account of you.\"', 'Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. The old man was clad in his', 'bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order. A maester did not remove it even to', 'sleep. \"The chair beside the fire would be pleasant,\" he said when he felt the warmth on his face. When', 'he was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.', '\"I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,\" Jon Snow said.', '\"You did not wake me,\" Maester Aemon replied. \"I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am', 'grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were', 'yesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you', 'come calling at this strange hour?\"', '\"To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night\\'s Watch.\"', '\"This is no concern of Maester Aemon,\" Chett complained.', '\"Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne,\" the', 'maester said gently. \"Only he may', 'say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know.

Let him train until he is ready,', 'no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.\"', '\"That\\'s stupid, \" Jon said. He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts. \"I remember once I asked', 'Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.\"', 'Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links.', '\"Go on.\"', 'Page 300', '', '\"He told me that a maester\\'s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve,\" Jon said,', 'remembering. \"I asked why each link was a different metal.

The', 'different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for', 'healing, iron for warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to', \"remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn't that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links\", \"can't make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest,\", 'and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a', 'land needs all sorts of people.\"', 'Maester Aemon smiled. \"And so?\"', '\"The Night\\'s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll', \"couldn't make Sam a warrior,\", \"and Ser Alliser won't either. You can't hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that\", 'doesn\\'t mean tin is useless. Why shouldn\\'t Sam be a steward?\"', 'Chett gave an angry scowl. \"I\\'m a steward. You think it\\'s easy work, fit for cowards? The order of', 'stewards keeps the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood,', 'cook the meals. Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The', 'stewards.\"', 'Maester Aemon was gentler. \"Is your friend a hunter?\"', '\"He hates hunting,\" Jon had to admit.', '\"Can he plow a field?\" the maester asked. \"Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a', 'cow?\"', '\"No.,,', 'Chett gave a nasty laugh. \"I\\'ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they\\'re put to work.

T\\'', '\"It means I shall think on what you have said,\" the maester told him firmly. \"And now, I believe I am', 'ready to sleep. Chett, show our young brother to the door.\"', 'TYRION', 'They had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road.

Try it, as you like . . . and forgive me if I do not linger', 'to bury you.\"', '\"You think to outlive me, dwarf?\" The sellsword grinned. He had a dark gap in his smile where the edge', \"of Ser Vardis Egen's shield had cracked a tooth in half.\", 'Tyrion shrugged. \"Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your', 'skull.

You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen', 'when he caught that arrow in his belly.\" Bronn had yanked back the man\\'s head by the hair and driven', 'the point of his dirk in under the ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died', 'of his wound.', '\"He was good as dead,\" Bronn said, \"and his moaning was bringing them down on us.

For gold. You were thinking', 'Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service. Here, that should', 'do, I hope. Do you have a flint?\"', 'Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint. Tyrion caught it in the air.', '\"My thanks,\" he said. \"The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable,', 'and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you', \"when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that's\", 'the most you could have hoped for.

He sat cross-legged beside the fire, honing the', 'edge of his longsword with an oilstone. There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping', 'sound it made when he drew it down the steel. \"It will be full dark soon,\" the sellsword pointed out. \"I\\'ll', 'take first watch . . . for all the good it will do us.

He smashed them together as he lumbered closer.', 'Other voices called other names, Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that Tyrion forgot the instant he', 'heard them; ten at least. A few had swords and knives; others brandished pitchforks and scythes and', 'wooden spears.

A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its', 'depths, riding upon the back of the first horse.', 'The procession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground.', 'Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud', 'squishing between her toes as she pushed through the tall reeds. The moon floated on the still black', 'waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as', \"the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion's blood had dried on her hands\", 'and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head, cleansing', 'herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the', 'dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying.', 'When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried to her with a', 'robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away.

She went to him and helped him unlace.', 'Then her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lift a child. The bells in his', 'hair rang softly.', 'Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself', 'inside her.

Mormont came at once, and went to one knee before', 'her. \"Khaleesi, \" he said, \"I am yours to command.\"', 'She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her. \"Sit and talk with me.\"', '\"You honor me.\" The knight seated himself cross-legged on the cushion.

Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare\\'s milk the', 'Dothraki drank, she knew that, and he was oft at the bazaars these days, drinking with the traders who', 'Page 330', '', 'came in the great caravans from east and west. He seemed to find their company more congenial than', 'hers.', '\"Wine,\" Ser Jorah confirmed, \"and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords', 'who guard the caravans.\" A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him, and he attacked it with both', 'hands.', '\"Is that wise?\" she asked. \"He has no gold to pay soldiers.

How dare you', \"presume to eat without me? No one eats before the king. Where is she? The whore can't hide from the\", 'dragon.\"', 'He stopped beside the largest of the three firepits, peering around at the faces of the Dothraki. There', 'were five thousand men in the hall, but only a handful who knew the Common Tongue. Yet even if his', 'words were incomprehensible, you had only to look at him to know that he was drunk.', 'Ser Jorah went to him swiftly, whispered something in his ear, and took him by the arm, but Viserys', 'wrenched free. \"Keep your hands off me! No one touches the dragon without leave.\"', 'Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench. Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khals', 'beside him. Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly.', 'The sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes. \"Khal Drogo,\" he said thickly, his voice almost polite.', '\"I\\'m here for the feast.\" He staggered away from Ser Jorah, making to join the three khals on the high', 'bench.', 'Khal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could understand, and pointed.', '\"Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,\" Ser Jorah translated for her brother. \"Khal Drogo', 'says your place is there.\"', 'Viserys glanced where the khal was pointing. At the back of the long hall, in a corner by the wall, deep', 'in shadow so better men would not need to look on them, sat the lowest of the low; raw unblooded', 'boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted and the maimed.

Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor.', '\"My hand,\" the guardsman yelped, cradling his broken fingers.', '\"You are quick, for a dancing master,\" said Ser Meryn.', '\"You are slow, for a knight,\" Syrio replied.', '\"Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,\" the knight in the white armor commanded.', 'Four Lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords. The fifth, with the broken fingers, spat and pulled', 'free a dagger with his left hand.', \"Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together, sliding into his water dancer's stance, presenting only his side to\", 'the foe. \"Arya child,\" he called out, never looking, never taking his eyes off the Lannisters, \"we are done', 'with dancing for the day. Best you are going now. Run to your father.\"', 'Arya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said. \"Swift as a deer, \" she', 'whispered.', '\"Just so,\" said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed.', 'Arya retreated, her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand. Watching him now, she realized that', 'Syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled. The red cloaks came at him from three sides with', 'steel in their hands. They had chainmail over their chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their', 'pants, but only leather on their legs. Their hands were bare, and the caps they wore had noseguards, but', 'no visor over the eyes.', 'Syrio did not wait for them to reach him, but spun to his left. Arya had never seen a man move as fast.', 'He checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second. Off balance, the second man', 'lurched into the first. Syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together. The third', \"guard came leaping over them, slashing at the water dancer's head. Syrio ducked under his blade and\", 'thrust upward. The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye', 'had been.', \"The fallen men were getting up. Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap off the other's\", \"head. The dagger man stabbed at him. Syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the man's\", 'kneecap with his stick. The last red cloak shouted a curse and charged, hacking down with both hands', \"on his sword. Syrio rolled right, and the butcher's cut caught the helmetless man between neck and\", 'shoulder as he struggled to his knees. The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh. The', 'man on his knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the apple of', 'his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at his neck, his face', 'blackening.', 'Page 357', '', 'Five men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened on the', 'kitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. \"Bloody oafs,\" he swore, drawing his longsword from its', 'scabbard.', 'Syrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. \"Arya child,\" he called out, never looking', 'at her, \"be gone now.\"', 'Look with your eyes, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, legs, throat, and', 'hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and in his hand cruel steel. Against that:', 'Syrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his hand. \"Syrio, run,\" she screamed.', '\"The first sword of Braavos does not run,\" he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio danced away', \"from his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartbeat, he had bounced blows off the knight's temple, elbow, and\", 'throat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet, and gorget. Arya stood frozen. Ser Meryn', 'advanced; Syrio backed away. He checked the next blow, spun away from the second, deflected the', 'third.', 'The fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core.', 'Sobbing, Arya spun and ran.', 'She plunged through the kitchens and buttery, blind with panic, weaving between cooks and potboys. A', \"baker's helper stepped in front of her, holding a wooden tray. Arya bowled her over, scattering fragrant\", 'loaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor. She heard shouting behind her as she spun around a portly', 'butcher who stood gaping at her with a cleaver in his hands. His arms were red to the elbow.', 'All that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head. Swift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow.', 'Fear cuts deeper than swords. Quick as a snake. Calm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords.', 'Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than swords. The man who fears losing has', 'already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Fear cuts deeper than', 'swords. The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard when she', 'reached the turret stair. For an instant she froze. Up or down? Up would take her to the covered bridge', \"that spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand, but that would be the way they'd expect her to\", 'go, for certain. Never do what they expect, Syrio once said. Arya went down, around and around,', 'leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time. She emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar,', 'surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall. The only light came through narrow slanting windows', 'high in the wall.', 'The cellar was a dead end. There was no way out but the way she', \"had come in. She dare not go back up those steps, but she couldn't stay here, either. She had to find her\", 'father and tell him what had happened. Her father would protect her.', 'Arya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb, leaping from cask to cask until she', 'could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, she pulled herself up. The wall was three', 'feet thick, the window a tunnel slanting up and out. Arya wriggled toward daylight. When her head', 'reached ground level, she peered across the bailey to the Tower of the Hand.', 'Page 358', '', 'The stout wooden door hung splintered and broken, as if by axes. A dead man sprawled facedown on', \"the steps, his cloak tangled beneath him, the back of his mailed shirt soaked red. The corpse's cloak was\", 'grey wool trimmed with white satin, she saw with sudden terror. She could not tell who he was.', '\"No, \" she whispered. What was happening? Where was her father? Why had the red cloaks come for', 'her? She remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said, the day she had found the monsters.', 'If one Hand can die, why not a second? Arya felt tears in her eyes. She held her breath to listen. She', 'heard the sounds of fighting, shouts, screams, the clang of steel on steel, coming through the windows of', 'the Tower of the Hand.', 'She could not go back. Her father . . .', 'Arya closed her eyes. For a moment she was too frightened to move. They had killed Jory and Wyl and', 'Heward, and that guardsman on the step, whoever he had been. They could kill her father too, and her if', 'they caught her. \"Fear cuts deeper than swords, \" she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a', 'water dancer, Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and anyhow', 'she was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid.', 'She squirmed out into the yard, glancing around warily as she climbed to her feet. The castle seemed', 'deserted. The Red Keep was never deserted. All the people must be hiding inside, their doors barred.', 'Arya glanced up longingly at her bedchamber, then moved away from the Tower of the Hand, keeping', 'close to the wall as she slid from shadow to shadow. She pretended she was chasing cats . . . except she', 'was the cat now, and if they caught her, they would kill her.', 'Moving between buildings and over walls, keeping stone to her back wherever possible so no one could', 'surprise her, Arya reached the stables almost without incident. A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate ran', 'past as she was edging across the inner bailey, but without knowing whose side they were on, she', 'hunched down low in the shadows and let them pass.', 'Hullen, who had been master of horse at Winterfell as long as Arya could remember, was slumped on', 'the ground by the stable door. He had been stabbed so many times it looked as if his tunic was patterned', 'with scarlet flowers. Arya was certain he was dead, but when she crept closer, his eyes opened. \"Arya', 'Underfoot,\" he whispered. \"You must . . . warn your . . . your lord father . . .\" Frothy red spittle bubbled', 'from his mouth. The master of horse closed his eyes again and said no more.', \"Inside were more bodies; a groom she had played with, and three of her father's household guard. A\", 'wagon, laden with crates and chests, stood abandoned near the door of the stable. The dead men must', 'have been loading it for the trip to the docks when they were attacked. Arya snuck closer. One of the', \"corpses was Desmond, who'd shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father. He lay on his\", 'back, staring blindly at the ceiling as flies crawled across his eyes. Close to him was a dead man in the', 'red cloak and lion-crest helm of the Lannisters. Only one, though. Every northerner is worth ten of these', 'southron swords, Desmond had told her. \"You liar!\" she said, kicking his body in a sudden fury.', \"The animals were restless in their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood. Arya's only plan\", 'was to saddle a horse and flee, away from the castle and the city. All she had to do was stay on the', 'kingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell. She took a bridle and harness off the wall.', 'As she crossed in back of the wagon, a fallen chest caught her eye. It must have been knocked down in', 'Page 359', '', \"the fight or dropped as it was being loaded. The wood had split, the lid opening to spill the chest's\", 'contents across the ground. Arya recognized silks and satins and velvets she never wore. She might need', 'warm clothes on the kingsroad, though . . . and besides . . .', 'Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes. She found a heavy woolen cloak, a velvet skirt and a', 'silk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress her mother had embroidered for her, a silver baby bracelet she', 'might sell. Shoving the broken lid out of the way, she groped inside the chest for Needle. She had hidden', 'it way down at the bottom, under everything, but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest', 'was dropped. For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it. Then her', 'fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown.', '\"There she is,\" a voice hissed close behind her.', 'Startled, Arya whirled. A stableboy stood behind her, a smirk on his face, his filthy white undertunic', 'peeking out from beneath a soiled', 'jerkin. His boots were covered with manure, and he had a pitchfork in one hand. \"Who are you?\" she', 'asked.', '\"She don\\'t know me,\" he said, \"but I knows her, oh, yes. The wolf girl.\"', '\"Help me saddle a horse,\" Arya pleaded, reaching back into the chest, groping for Needle. \"My father\\'s', 'the Hand of the King, he\\'ll reward you.\"', '\"Father\\'s dead,\" the boy said. He shuffled toward her. \"It\\'s the queen who\\'ll be rewarding me. Come', 'here, girl.\"', '\"Stay away!\" Her fingers closed around Needle\\'s hilt.', '\"I says, come.\" He grabbed her arm, hard.', 'Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat. In that instant of sudden terror, the', 'only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her, the very first.', 'She stuck him with the pointy end, driving the blade upward with a wild, hysterical strength.', 'Needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out between his shoulder', 'blades. The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise, something between a gasp and a sigh. His', 'hands closed around the blade. \"Oh, gods,\" he moaned, as his undertunic began to redden. \"Take it out.\"', 'When she took it out, he died.', 'The horses were screaming. Arya stood over the body, still and frightened in the face of death. Blood', \"had gushed from the boy's mouth as he collapsed, and more was seeping from the slit in his belly, pooling\", \"beneath his body. His palms were cut where he'd grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly,\", 'Needle red in her hand. She had to get away, someplace far from here, someplace safe away from the', \"stableboy's accusing eyes.\", 'She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare, but as she lifted the saddle to the', 'Page 360', '', \"horse's back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed. Even the\", \"postern doors would likely be guarded. Maybe the guards wouldn't recognize her. If they thought she\", \"was a boy, perhaps they'd let her . . . no, they'd have orders not to let anyone out, it wouldn't matter\", 'whether they knew her or not.', 'But there was another way out of the castle . . .', \"The saddle slipped from Arya's fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust. Could she find\", \"the room with the monsters again? She wasn't certain, yet she knew she had to try.\", \"She found the clothing she'd gathered and slipped into the cloak, concealing Needle beneath its folds.\", 'The rest of her things she tied in a', 'roll. With the bundle under her arm, she crept to the far end of the stable. Unlatching the back door, she', 'peeked out anxiously. She could hear the distant sound of swordplay, and the shivery wail of a man', 'screaming in pain across the bailey. She would need to go down the serpentine steps, past the small', \"kitchen and the pig yard, that was how she'd gone last time, chasing the black tomcat . . . only that would\", \"take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks. She couldn't go that way. Arya tried to think of\", 'another way. If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the river wall and', \"through the little godswood . . . but first she'd have to cross the yard, in the plain view of the guards on\", 'the walls.', 'She had never seen so many men on the walls. Gold cloaks, most of them, armed with spears. Some of', \"them knew her by sight. What would they do if they saw her running across the yard? She'd look so\", 'small from up there, would they be able to tell who she was? Would they care?', 'She had to leave now, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was too frightened to move.', 'Calm as still water, a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost dropped her', 'bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but her, and the horses, and the', 'dead men.', \"Quiet as a shadow, she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio's? She could not tell, yet somehow it\", 'calmed her fears.', 'She stepped out of the stable.', \"It was the scariest thing she'd ever done. She wanted to run and hide, but she made herself walk across\", 'the yard, slowly, putting one foot in front of the other as if she had all the time in the world and no reason', 'to be afraid of anyone. She thought she could feel their eyes, like bugs crawling on her skin under her', 'clothes. Arya never looked up. If she saw them watching, all her courage would desert her, she knew,', 'and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby, and then they would have her. She', 'kept her gaze on the ground. By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the', 'yard, Arya was cold with sweat, but no one had raised the hue and cry.', 'The sept was open and empty. Inside, half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant silence. Arya', 'figured the gods would never miss two. She stuffed them up her sleeves, and left by a back window.', 'Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one-eared tom was easy, but after that she got', 'lost. She crawled in and out of windows, hopped over walls, and felt her way through dark cellars, quiet', 'Page 361', '', 'as a shadow. Once she heard a woman weeping. It took her more than an hour to find the low narrow', 'window that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited.', \"She tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle. That was chancy; the fire she'd\", 'remembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals.', 'Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle, she went out the window as they were coming in the', 'door, without ever getting a glimpse of who it was.', 'This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. Arya held the candle over', 'her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch', 'her pass. \"Dragons, \" she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade', 'seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand.', 'The long windowless hall beyond the door was as black as she remembered. She held Needle in her left', 'hand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot wax ran down across her knuckles. The entrance', 'to the well had been to the left, so Arya went right. Part of her wanted to run, but she was afraid of', 'snuffing out her candle. She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on', 'the edge of the light, but rats did not scare her. Other things did. It would be so easy to hide here, as she', 'had hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard. She could almost see the stableboy', 'standing against the wall, his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in', 'his palms where Needle had cut him. He might be waiting to grab her as she passed. He would see her', 'candle coming a long way off. Maybe she would be better off without the light . . .', 'Fear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya remembered the', \"crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She'd been just a little girl the\", \"first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who'd\", \"been no bigger than Rickon was now. They'd only had one candle between them, and Bran's eyes had\", 'gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their', 'feet and their iron swords across their laps.', 'Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them', 'their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had', 'told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. \"There', 'are worse things than spiders', 'and rats,\" he whispered. \"This is where the dead walk.\" That was when they heard the sound, low and', \"deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya's hand.\", 'When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for', \"the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb's leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the\", 'spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. \"You stupid,\" she told him, \"you scared the baby,\" but', 'Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.', 'The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. The stableboy', \"was dead, she'd killed him, and if he jumped out at her she'd kill him again. She was going home.\", \"Everything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell's grey granite walls.\", 'Page 362', '', 'Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness.', 'SANSA', 'They came for Sansa on the third day.', 'She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and', 'sleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of', 'servants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all her', 'crying, and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father.', '\"I\\'m certain your father is well,\" Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. \"I\\'ll', 'ask the queen to let you see him.\" She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne\\'s spirits, but the other girl just', 'looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a child.', \"Sansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor's Holdfast, with her door\", 'closed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began. She had grown up to the sound', 'of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on', 'sword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it', 'as she had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curses,', 'shouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men. In the songs, the knights never screamed nor', 'begged for mercy.', 'So she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling for her father,', 'for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave', 'no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside,', 'bruised and shaking. \"They\\'re killing everyone, \" the steward\\'s daughter had shrieked at her. She went on', 'and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she said. There were bodies on the', 'stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as she', \"struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other's arms like\", 'sisters.', 'The second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined was at the top of the', \"highest tower of Maegor's Holdfast. From its window, she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the\", 'gatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the', 'keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with', 'spears and crossbows to hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the grave had settled over the', \"Red Keep. The only sounds were Jeyne Poole's endless whimpers and sobs.\", 'They were fed-hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast chicken and', 'greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew-but the servants who brought the meals', \"would not answer Sansa's questions. That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of\", \"the Hand, and some of Jeyne's things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when\", 'she tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The guards outside the door still', 'refused to let them leave the room.', 'Page 363', '', '\"Please, I need to speak to the queen again,\" Sansa told them, as she told everyone she saw that day.', '\"She\\'ll want to talk to me, I know she will. Tell her I want to see her, please. If not the queen, then Prince', 'Joffrey, if you\\'d be so kind. We\\'re to marry when we\\'re older.\"', 'At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring. Its voice was deep and sonorous, and the long', 'slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing went on and on, and after a while they heard', \"other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's Hill. The sound rumbled across the city\", 'like thunder, warning of the storm to come.', '\"What is it?\" Jeyne asked, covering her ears. \"Why are they ringing the bells?\"', '\"The king is dead.\" Sansa could not say how she knew it, yet she', 'did. The slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the', 'castle and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard?', 'She went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey the king now? Or had they', 'killed him too? She was afraid for him, and for her father. If only they would tell her what was happening', '. . .', 'That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven', 'gold. She had a crown on her head, and everyone she had ever known came before her, to bend the', 'knee and say their courtesies.', 'The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort her', 'to the queen.', 'Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat, his cheeks', 'baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was', 'fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies. \"You', 'look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros,\" Sansa told him. A lady remembered her', 'courtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what.', '\"And you, my lady,\" Ser Boros said in a flat voice. \"Her Grace awaits. Come with me.\"', 'There were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms.', 'Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed. It was the first', 'time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings', 'past. \"To keep you safe, my sweet one,\" Queen Cersei had told her. \"Joffrey would never forgive me if', 'anything happened to his precious.\"', 'Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out', \"of Maegor's Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into\", 'the depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes', 'below. She averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone', 'she knew.', 'They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table littered with', 'papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen.', 'Page 364', '', 'She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door.', '\"Your Grace,\" Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by', 'another of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face, \"I\\'ve brought the girl.\"', \"Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the king's councillors\", \"were.

All of them were clad in black, she realized with', 'a feeling of dread. Mourning clothes . . .', 'The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice,', 'covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping', 'blood.

I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber.\"', 'Page 365', '', '\"As you command, Your Grace,\" Ser Boros said. He bowed deeply, spun on his heel, and took his', 'leave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him.', 'Sansa was confused. \"I don\\'t understand,\" she said. \"Where is Jeyne\\'s father? Why can\\'t Ser Boros take', 'her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?\" She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle', 'as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again.', 'For a second she thought she might cry. \"Where are you sending her?

The yard rang to the sound of sword and axe, the rumble of', 'wagons, and the barking of dogs. The armory doors were open, and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge,', 'his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest. Bran had never seen as many strangers in all his', 'years, not even when King Robert had come to visit Father.', 'He tried not to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door.

Hodor hated cold water, and would fight', 'like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool', 'and sit for hours, giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green', 'depths to break upon the surface.', \"Summer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran's side. He rubbed the wolf under the jaw, and for\", 'a moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had always liked the godswood, even before, but of', 'late he found himself drawn to it more and more. Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used', 'to. The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took comfort from', 'that now. The gods were looking over him, he told himself; the old gods, gods of the Starks and the First', \"Men and the children of the forest, hisfather's gods.

The wolf was near as wild as Rickon; he'd bitten Gage on the\", \"arm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken's thigh. It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring\", 'him to bay. Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now, and Rickon cried all the more for', 'being without him.', 'Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded with him too, for his own', 'sake as much as Rickon\\'s, but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said, \"I don\\'t want to go.

A note of doubt crept into his voice. \"Isn\\'t it?\"', '\"I don\\'t know.\" He gave a weary shake of his head. \"Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south', \"with us. To cook for him, he says.

He understood about mating; he had seen dogs in the yard, and watched a', 'Page 387', '', 'stallion mount a mare. But talking about it made him uncomfortable.

When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility charm at a', \"magician's booth, Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid, thinking that now she should find\", 'something for Irri and Jhiqui as well.', 'Turning a corner, they came upon a wine merchant offering thimble-sized cups of his wares to the', 'passersby. \"Sweet reds,\" he cried in fluent Dothraki, \"I have sweet reds, from Lys and Volantis and the', 'Arbor. Whites from Lys, Tyroshi pear brandy, firewine, pepperwine, the pale green nectars of Myr.', 'Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have them, I have them.\" He was a small man, slender and', 'handsome, his flaxen hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of Lys. When Dany paused before his', 'stall, he bowed low. \"A taste for the khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady, it sings of plums', 'and cherries and rich dark oak. A cask, a cup, a swallow? One taste, and you will name your child after', 'me.\"', 'Dany smiled. \"My son has his name, but I will try your summerwine,\" she said in Valyrian, Valyrian as', 'they spoke it in the Free Cities. The words felt strange on her tongue, after so long. \"Just a taste, if you', 'would be so kind.\"', 'The merchant must have taken her for Dothraki, with her clothes and her oiled hair and sun-browned', 'skin. When she spoke, he gaped at her in astonishment. \"My lady, you are . . . Tyroshi? Can it be so?\"', '\"My speech may be Tyroshi, and my garb Dothraki, but I am of Westeros, of the Sunset Kingdoms,\"', 'Dany told him.', 'Doreah stepped up beside her. \"You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen,', 'Daenerys Stormborn, khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.\"', 'The wine merchant dropped to his knees. \"Princess,\" he said, bowing his head.', '\"Rise,\" Dany commanded him. \"I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of.\"', 'The man bounded to his feet. \"That? Dornish swill. It is not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from', 'the Arbor, crisp and delectable. Please, let me give you a cask.\"', \"Khal Drogo's visits to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good\", 'wine, and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him. \"You honor me, ser,\" she murmured', 'sweetly.', '\"The honor is mine.\" The merchant rummaged about in the back of his stall and produced a small oaken', 'cask. Burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes. \"The Redwyne sigil,\" he said, pointing, \"for the', 'Arbor. There is no finer drink.\"', 'Page 394', '', '\"Khal Drogo and I will share it together. Aggo, take this back to my litter, if you\\'d be so kind.\" The', 'wineseller beamed as the Dothraki hefted the cask.', 'She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say, \"No. \" His voice was', 'strange, brusque. \"Aggo, put down that cask.\"', 'Aggo looked at Dany. She gave a hesitant nod. \"Ser Jorah, is something wrong?\"', '\"I have a thirst. Open it, wineseller.\"', 'The merchant frowned. \"The wine is for the khaleesi, not for the likes of you, ser.\"', 'Ser Jorah moved closer to the stall. \"If you don\\'t open it, I\\'ll crack it open with your head.\" He carried', 'no weapons here in the sacred city, save his hands-yet his hands were enough, big, hard, dangerous, his', 'knuckles covered with coarse dark hairs. The wineseller hesitated a moment, then took up his hammer', 'and knocked the plug from the cask.', '\"Pour,\" Ser Jorah commanded. The four young warriors of Dany\\'s khas arrayed themselves behind him,', 'frowning, watching with their dark, almond-shaped eyes.', '\"It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe.\" The wineseller had not put his', 'hammer down.', 'Jhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt, but Dany stopped him with a light touch on the arm. \"Do', 'as Ser Jorah says,\" she said. People were stopping to watch.', 'The man gave her a quick, sullen glance. \"As the princess commands.\" He had to set aside his hammer', 'to lift the cask. He filled two thimble-sized tasting cups, pouring so deftly he did not spill a drop.', 'Ser Jorah lifted a cup and sniffed at the wine, frowning.', '\"Sweet, isn\\'t it?\" the wineseller said, smiling. \"Can you smell the fruit, ser? The perfume of the Arbor.', 'Taste it, my lord, and tell me it isn\\'t the finest, richest wine that\\'s ever touched your tongue.\"', 'Ser Jorah offered him the cup. \"You taste it first.\"', '\"Me?\" The man laughed. \"I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord. And it\\'s a poor wine merchant who', 'drinks up his own wares.\" His smile was amiable, yet she could see the sheen of sweat on his brow.', '\"You will drink,\" Dany said, cold as ice. \"Empty the cup, or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser', 'Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat.\"', 'The wineseller shrugged, reached for the cup . . . and grabbed the cask instead, flinging it at her with', 'both hands. Ser Jorah bulled into her, knocking her out of the way. The cask bounced off his shoulder', 'and smashed open on the ground. Dany stumbled and lost her feet. \"No, \" she screamed, thrusting her', 'hands out to break her fall . . . and Doreah caught her by the arm and wrenched her backward, so she', 'landed on her legs and not her belly.', 'Page 395', '', 'The trader vaulted over the stall, darting between Aggo and Rakharo. Quaro reached for an arakh that', 'was not there as the blond man slammed him aside. He raced down the aisle. Dany heard the snap of', \"Jhogo's whip, saw the leather lick out and coil around the wineseller's leg. The man sprawled face first in\", 'the dirt.', 'A dozen caravan guards had come running. With them was the master himself, Merchant Captain Byan', 'Votyris, a diminutive Norvoshi with skin like old leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to', 'his ears.

Two guards hauled', 'the wineseller to his feet. \"His goods I gift to you as well, Princess,\" the merchant captain went on. \"Small', 'token of regret, that one of mine would do this thing.\"', 'Doreah and Jhiqui helped Dany back to her feet. The poisoned wine was leaking from the broken cask', 'into the dirt. \"How did you know?\" she asked Ser Jorah, trembling. \"How?\"', '\"I did not know, Khaleesi, not until the man refused to drink, but once I read Magister Illyrio\\'s letter, I', 'feared.\" His dark eyes swept over the faces of the strangers in the market. \"Come.

For years she had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of waking the dragon. This was even worse. It', 'was not just for herself that she feared now, but for her baby. He must have sensed her fright, for he', 'moved restlessly inside her. Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently, wishing she could reach him,', 'touch him, soothe him. \"You are the blood of the dragon, little one,\" she whispered as her litter swayed', 'along, curtains drawn tight. \"You are the blood of the dragon, and the dragon does not fear.\"', 'Under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak, Dany ordered them to leave', 'her-all but Ser Jorah. \"Tell', 'me,\" she commanded as she lowered herself onto her cushions. \"Was it the Usurper?\"', '\"Yes.\" The knight drew out a folded parchment. \"A letter to Viserys, from Magister Illyrio.

The Usurper owes Drogo a', 'lordship.\" This time her laugh was half a sob. She hugged herself protectively. \"And me, you said. Only', 'me?\"', '\"You and the child,\" Ser Jorah said, grim.', '\"No. He cannot have my son.\" She would not weep, she decided. She would not shiver with fear. The', \"Usurper has woken the dragon now, she told herself . . . and her eyes went to the dragon's eggs resting\", 'in their nest of dark velvet.

Or some strange wisdom buried in her blood? Dany', 'could not have said. She heard her own voice saying, \"Ser Jorah, light the brazier.\"', '\"Khaleesi?\" The knight looked at her strangely. \"It is so hot. Are you certain?\"', 'Page 396', '', 'She had never been so certain. \"Yes. I . . . I have a chill.

As she stepped back from', 'the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat.', 'She watched until the coals had turned to ashes. Drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole.', \"Heat shimmered in waves around the dragon's eggs. And that was all.\", 'Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, Ser Jorah had said. Dany gazed at her eggs sadly. What had', 'she expected? A thousand thousand years ago they had been alive, but now they were only pretty rocks.', 'They could not make a dragon. A dragon was air and fire. Living flesh, not dead stone.', 'The brazier was cold again by the time Khal Drogo returned.

Or if they did, they shied away as if she had the', 'grey plague. Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing, and when', 'funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her, Ser Balon Swann whispered in his ear and he turned away.', 'And so many others were missing. Where had the rest of them gone? Sansa wondered. Vainly, she', 'searched for friendly faces. Not one of them would meet her eyes. It was as if she had become a ghost,', 'dead before her time.', 'Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, seemingly asleep, his hands clasped', 'together atop his beard. She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall, his feet making no sound. A moment', 'later Lord Baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear, smiling. He chatted amiably with Ser Balon', \"and Ser Dontos as he made his way to the front. Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa's stomach. I\", \"shouldn't be afraid, she told herself.

He was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet, with an ermine', 'collar and shiny gold fastenings. From a drooping sleeve, heavy with gilded scrollwork, he drew a', 'parchment, unrolled it, and began to read a long list of names, commanding each in the name of king and', 'council to present themselves and swear their fealty to Joffrey.

So many, she thought as Pycelle read on and on, it will take a whole flock of', 'ravens to send out these commands.', 'And at the end, near last, came the names Sansa had been dreading. Lady Catelyn Stark. Robb Stark.', 'Brandon Stark, Rickon Stark, Arya Stark. Sansa stifled a gasp. Arya. They wanted Arya to present', 'herself and swear an oath . . . it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, she must be safe at Winterfell', 'by now . . .', 'Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list, tucked it up his left sleeve, and pulled another parchment from', 'his right.

He did not know which was', 'more painful, the waking or the sleeping. When he slept, he dreamed: dark disturbing dreams of blood', 'and broken promises. When he woke, there was nothing to do but think, and his waking thoughts were', 'worse than nightmares. The thought of Cat was as painful as a bed of nettles.

He could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg, an itch beneath the', 'Page 419', '', 'plaster. When he touched his thigh, the flesh was hot to his fingers. The only sound was his breathing.', 'After a time, he began to talk aloud, just to hear a voice. He made plans to keep himself sane, built', \"castles of hope in the dark.

Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off\", \"the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and\", 'Shagga refuse to pay.\"', '\"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander,\" his father said.', 'His brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly, and die for him if need be.', 'Tyrion lacked that gift. He bought loyalty with gold, and compelled obedience with his name. \"A bigger', 'man would be able to put the fear in them, is that what you\\'re saying, my lord?\"', 'Lord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother. \"If my son\\'s men will not obey his commands, perhaps the', 'vanguard is not the place for him.

Tyrion turned and walked away. He was conscious of', 'their eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill. A great gust of laughter went up from behind him, but', 'he did not look back. He hoped they all choked on their suckling pigs.', 'Dusk had settled, turning all the banners black. The Lannister camp sprawled for miles between the river', 'and the kingsroad. In amongst the men and the horses and the trees, it was easy to get lost, and `I~rion', 'did. He passed a dozen great pavilions and a hundred cookfires. Fireflies drifted amongst the tents like', 'wandering stars. He caught the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory, so tempting it made his empty', 'stomach growl. Away in the distance, he heard voices raised in some bawdy song. A giggling woman', 'raced past him, naked beneath a dark cloak, her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots. Farther on,', 'two spearmen faced each other across a little trickle of a stream, practicing their thrust- and-parry in the', 'fading light, their chests bare and slick with sweat.', 'No one looked at him. No one spoke to him. No one paid him any mind. He was surrounded by men', 'sworn to House Lannister, a vast host twenty thousand strong, and yet he was alone.', \"When he heard the deep rumble of Shagga's laughter booming\", 'through the dark, he followed it to the Stone Crows in their small corner of the night. Conn son of Coratt', 'waved a tankard of ale. \"Tyrion Halftnan! Come, sit by our fire, share meat with the Stone Crows. We', 'have an ox.\"', '\"I can see that, Conn son of Coratt.\" The huge red carcass was suspended over a roaring fire, skewered', 'on a spit the size of a small tree. No doubt it was a small tree. Blood and grease dripped down into the', 'flames as two Stone Crows turned the meat. \"I thank you. Send for me when the ox is cooked.\" From', 'the look of it, that might even be before the battle. He walked on.', 'Each clan had its own cookfire; Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows, Stone Crows did not eat with', \"Moon Brothers, and no one ate with Burned Men. The modest tent he had coaxed out of Lord Lefford's\", 'stores had been erected in the center of the four fires. Tyrion found Bronn sharing a skin of wine with the', 'new servants. Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs, and even', 'insisted he take a squire. They were seated around the embers of a small cookfire. A girl was with them;', 'slim, dark-haired, no more than eighteen by the look of her. Tyrion studied her face for a moment, before', 'he spied fishbones in the ashes. \"What did you eat?\"', '\"Trout, m\\'lord,\" said his groom. \"Bronn caught them.\"', 'Trout, he thought. Suckling pig. Damn my father. He stared mournfully at the bones, his belly rumbling.', 'His squire, a boy with the unfortunate name of Podrick Payne, swallowed whatever he had been about', \"to say. The lad was a distant cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne, the king's headsman . . . and almost as quiet,\", 'although not for want of a tongue. Tyrion had made him stick it out once, just to be certain. \"Definitely a', 'tongue,\" he had said. \"Someday you must learn to use it.\"', 'Page 453', '', 'At the moment, he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad, whom he', 'suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape. Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl. \"Is this', 'her?\" he asked Bronn.', 'She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more. \"It is, m\\'lord, and', 'she can speak for herself, if it please you.\"', 'He cocked his head to one side. \"I am Tyrion, of House Lannister. Men call me the Imp.\"', '\"My mother named me Shae. Men call me . . . often.\"', 'Bronn laughed, and Tyrion had to smile. \"Into the tent, Shae, if you would be so kind.\" He lifted the flap', 'and held it for her. Inside, he knelt to light a candle.', 'The life of a soldier was not without certain compensations. Wherever you have a camp, you are certain', \"to have camp followers. At the end of the day's march, Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely\", 'whore. \"I would prefer one who is reasonably young, with as pretty a face as you can find,\" he had said.', '\"If she has washed sometime this year, I shall be glad. If she hasn\\'t, wash her. Be certain that you tell her', 'who I am, and warn her of what I am.\" Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the', \"girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they'd been hired to pleasure . . . a\", 'took that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again.', 'He lifted the candle and looked her over. Bronn had done well enough; she was doe-eyed and slim, with', 'small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, insolent, and wicked. He liked that. \"Shall I take my', 'gown off, m\\'lord?\" she asked.', '\"In good time. Are you a maiden, Shae?\"', '\"If it please you, m\\'lord,\" she said demurely.', '\"What would please me would be the truth of you, girl.\"', '\"Aye, but that will cost you double.\"', 'Tyrion decided they would get along splendidly. \"I am a Lannister. Gold I have in plenty, and you\\'ll find', \"me generous . . . but I'll want more from you than what you've got between your legs, though I'll want\", \"that too. You'll share my tent, pour my wine, laugh at my jests, rub the ache from my legs after each day's\", 'ride . . . and whether I keep you a day or a year, for so long as we are together you will take no other', 'men into your bed.\"', '\"Fair enough.\" She reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and pulled it up over her head', 'in one smooth motion, tossing it aside. There was nothing underneath but Shae. \"If he don\\'t put down that', 'candle, m1ord will burn his fingers.\"', 'Tyrion put down the candle, took her hand in his, and pulled her gently to him. She bent to kiss him. Her', 'mouth tasted of honey and cloves, and her fingers were deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of', 'his clothes.', 'Page 454', '', 'When he entered her, she welcomed him with whispered endearments and small, shuddering gasps of', 'pleasure. Tyrion suspected her delight was feigned, but she did it so well that it did not matter. That much', 'truth he did not crave.', 'He had needed her, Tyrion realized afterward, as she lay quietly in his arms. Her or someone like her. It', \"had been nigh on a year since he'd lain with a woman, since before he had set out for Winterfell in\", 'company with his brother and King Robert. He could well die on the morrow or the day after, and if he', 'did, he would sooner go to his grave', 'thinking of Shae than of his lord father, Lysa Arryn, or the Lady Catelyn Stark.', 'He could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against his arm as she lay beside him. That was a good', 'feeling. A song filled his head. Softly, quietly, he began to whistle.', '\"What\\'s that, m\\'lord?\" Shae murmured against him.', '\"Nothing,\" he told her. \"A song I learned as a boy, that\\'s all. Go to sleep, sweetling.\"', 'When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out from beneath her, gently,', 'so as not to disturb her sleep. Naked, he crawled outside, stepped over his squire, and walked around', 'behind his tent to make water.', \"Bronn was seated cross-legged under a chestnut tree, near where they'd tied the horses. He was honing\", 'the edge of his sword, wide awake; the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men. \"Where did you', 'find her?\" Tyrion asked him as he pissed.', '\"I took her from a knight. The man was loath to give her up, but your name changed his thinking', 'somewhat . . . that, and my dirk at his throat.\"', '\"Splendid,\" Tyrion said dryly, shaking off the last drops. \"I seem to recall saying find me a whore, not', 'make me an enemy.\"', '\"The pretty ones were all claimed,\" Bronn said. \"I\\'ll be pleased to take her back if you\\'d prefer a', 'toothless drab.\"', 'Tyrion limped closer to where he sat. \"My lord father would call that insolence, and send you to the', 'mines for impertinence.\"', '\"Good for me you\\'re not your father,\" Bronn replied. \"I saw one with boils all over her nose. Would you', 'like her?\"', '\"What, and break your heart?\" Tyrion shot back. \"I shall keep Shae. Did you perchance note the name', 'of this knight you took her from? I\\'d rather not have him beside me in the battle.\"', 'Bronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning his sword in his hand. \"You\\'ll have me beside you in the', 'battle, dwarf.\"', 'Tyrion nodded. The night air was warm on his bare skin. \"See that I survive this battle, and you can', 'name your reward.\"', 'Page 455', '', 'Bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left, and tried a cut. \"Who\\'d want to kill the likes', 'of you?\"', '\"My lord father, for one. He\\'s put me in the van.\"', '\"I\\'d do the same. A small man with a big shield. You\\'ll give the archers fits.\"', '\"I find you oddly cheering,\" Tyrion said. \"I must be mad.\"', 'Bronn sheathed his sword. \"Beyond a doubt.\"', 'When Tyrion returned to his tent, Shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured sleepily, \"I woke and', 'm\\'lord was gone.\"', '\"M\\'Iord is back now.\" He slid in beside her.', 'Her hand went between his stunted legs, and found him hard. \"Yes he is,\" she whispered, stroking him.', 'He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and she named the minor retainer of an', 'insignificant lordling. \"You need not fear his like, m\\'lord,\" the girl said, her fingers busy at his cock. \"He is', 'a small man.\"', '\"And what am 1, pray?\" Tyrion asked her. \"A giant?\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" she purred, \"my giant of Lannister.\" She mounted him then, and for a time, she almost made', 'him believe it. Tyrion went to sleep smiling . . .', '* \\' * and woke in darkness to the blare of trumpets. Shae was shaking him by the shoulder. \"M\\'Iord,\"', 'she whispered. \"Wake up, m\\'lord. I\\'m frightened.\"', 'Groggy, he sat up and threw back the blanket. The horns called through the night, wild and urgent, a cry', 'that said huny huny huny. He heard shouts, the clatter of spears, the whicker of horses, though nothing', 'yet that spoke to him of fighting. \"My lord father\\'s trumpets,\" he said. \"Battle assembly. I thought Stark', 'was yet a day\\'s march away.\"', 'Shae shook her head, lost. Her eyes were wide and white.', 'Groaning, Tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside, shouting for his squire. Wisps of pale', 'fog drifted through the night, long white fingers off the river. Men and horses blundered through the', 'predawn chill; saddles were being cinched, wagons loaded, fires extinguished. The trumpets blew again:', 'huny huny huny. Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their sword belts as', 'they ran. When he found Pod, the boy was snoring softly. Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with', 'his toe. \"My armor,\" he said, \"and be quick about it.\" Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already', 'armored and ahorse, wearing his battered halfhelm. \"Do you know what\\'s happened?\" Tyrion asked him.', '\"The Stark boy stole a march on us,\" Bronn said. \"He crept down the kingsroad in the night, and now his', 'host is less than a mile north of here, forming up in battle array.\"', 'Page 456', '', 'Huny, the trumpets called, huny huny huny.', '\"See that the clansmen are ready to ride.\" Tyrion ducked back inside his tent. \"Where are my clothes?\"', 'he barked at Shae. \"There. No, the leather, damn it. Yes. Bring me my boots.\"', 'By the time he was dressed, his squire had laid out his armor, such that it was. Tyrion owned a fine suit', 'of heavy plate, expertly crafted to', 'fit his misshapen body. Alas, it was safe at Casterly Rock, and he was not. He had to make do with', \"oddments assembled from Lord Lefford's wagons: mail hauberk and coif, a dead knight's gorget,\", 'lobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots. Some of it was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it', 'matched, or fit as it should. His breastplate was meant for a bigger man; for his oversize head, they found', 'a huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike.', 'Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps. \"If I die, weep for me,\" Tyrion told the whore.', '\"How will you know? You\\'ll be dead.\"', '\"I\\'ll know.\"', '\"I believe you would.\" Shae lowered the greathelm down over his head, and Pod fastened it to his', 'gorget. Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk. By then his groom had', 'brought up his mount, a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was. He needed help to', 'mount; he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone. Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab of', 'heavy ironwood banded with steel. Lastly they gave him his battle-axe. Shae stepped back and looked', 'him over. \"NI\\'lord looks fearsome.\"', '\"NI\\'lord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor,\" Tyrion answered sourly, \"but I thank you for the kindness.', 'Podrick, should the battle go against us, see the lady safely home.\" He saluted her with his axe, wheeled', 'his horse about, and trotted off. His stomach was a hard knot, so tight it pained him. Behind, his servants', 'hurriedly began to strike his tent. Pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays of the sun', 'broke over the horizon. The western sky was a deep purple, speckled with stars. Tyrion wondered', 'whether this was the last sunrise he would ever see . . . and whether wondering was a mark of', 'cowardice. Did his brother Jaime ever contemplate death before a battle?', 'A warhorn sounded in the far distance, a deep mournful note that chilled the soul. The clansmen climbed', 'onto their scrawny mountain horses, shouting curses and rude jokes. Several appeared to be drunk. The', 'rising sun was burning off the drifting tendrils of fog as Tyrion led them off. What grass the horses had left', 'was heavy with dew, as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth. The', 'mountain men fell in behind him, each clan arrayed behind its own leaders.', 'In the dawn light, the army of Lord Tywin Lannister unfolded like an iron rose, thorns gleaming.', 'His uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad. Quivers', 'hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines, to east and west of the', 'road,', 'Page 457', '', 'and stood calmly stringing their bows. Between them, pikemen formed squares; behind were rank on', 'rank of men-at-arms with spear and sword and axe. Three hundred heavy horse surrounded Ser Kevan', 'and the lords bannermen Lefford, Lydden, and Serrett with all their sworn retainers.', 'The right wing was all cavalry, some four thousand men, heavy with the weight of their armor. More than', 'three quarters of the knights were there, massed together like a great steel fist. Ser Addam Marbrand', 'had the command. Tyrion saw his banner unfurl as his standardbearer shook it out; a burning tree, orange', \"and smoke. Behind him flew Ser Flement's purple unicorn, the brindled boar of Crakehall, the bantam\", 'rooster of Swyft, and more.', 'His lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept. Around him, the reserve assembled; a huge', 'force, half mounted and half foot, five thousand strong. Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the', 'reserve; he would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below him, committing his forces', 'when and where they were needed most.', \"Even from afar, his lord father was resplendent. Tywin Lannister's battle armor put his son Jaime's gilded\", 'suit to shame. His greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of cloth-of-gold, so heavy that it barely', \"stirred even when he charged, so large that its drape covered most of his stallion's hindquarters when he\", 'took the saddle. No ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight, so the greatcloak was held in place', 'by a matched pair of miniature lionesses crouching on his shoulders, as if poised to spring. Their mate, a', \"male with a magnificent mane, reclined atop Lord Tywin's greathelm, one paw raking the air as he\", 'roared. All three lions were wrought in gold, with ruby eyes. His armor was heavy steel plate, enameled', 'in a dark crimson, greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold scrollwork. His rondels were golden', 'sunbursts, all his fastenings were gilded, and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone', 'like fire in the light of the rising sun.', \"Tyrion could hear the rumble of the foemen's drums now. He remembered Robb Stark as he had last\", \"seen him, in his father's high seat in the Great Hall of Winterfell, a sword naked and shining in his hands.\", 'He remembered how the direwolves had come at him out of the shadows, and suddenly he could see', 'them again, snarling and snapping, teeth bared in his face. Would the boy bring his wolves to war with', 'him? The thought made him uneasy.', 'The northerners would be exhausted after their long sleepless march. Tyrion wondered what the boy had', 'been thinking. Did he think', 'to take them unawares while they slept? Small chance of that; whatever else might be said of him, Tywin', \"Lannister was no man's fool.\", 'The van was massing on the left. He saw the standard first, three black dogs on a yellow field. Ser', 'Gregor sat beneath it, mounted on the biggest horse Tyrion had ever seen. Bronn took one look at him', 'and grinned. \"Always follow a big man into battle.\"', 'Tyrion threw him a hard look. \"And why is that?\"', '\"They make such splendid targets. That one, he\\'ll draw the eyes of every bowman on the field.\"', 'Laughing, Tyrion regarded the Mountain with fresh eyes. \"I confess, I had not considered it in that light.\"', 'Clegane had no splendor about him; his armor was steel plate, dull grey, scarred by hard use and', 'Page 458', '', 'showing neither sigil nor ornament. He was pointing men into position with his blade, a two-handed', 'greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger. \"Any man', 'runs, I\\'ll cut him down myself,\" he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion. \"Imp! Take the left. Hold', 'the river. If you can.\"', 'The left of the left. To turn their flank, the Starks would need horses that could run on water. Tyrion led', 'his men toward the riverbank. \"Look,\" he shouted, pointing with his axe. \"The river.\" A blanket of pale', 'mist still clung to the surface of the water, the murky green current swirling past underneath. The shallows', 'were muddy and choked with reeds. \"That river is ours. Whatever happens, keep close to the water.', 'Never lose sight of it. Let no enemy come between us and our river. If they dirty our waters, hack off', 'their cocks and feed them to the fishes.\"', 'Shagga had an axe in either hand. He smashed them together and made them ring. \"Halfman!\" he', 'shouted. Other Stone Crows picked up the cry, and the Black Ears and Moon Brothers as well. The', 'Burned Men did not shout, but they rattled their swords and spears. \"Halfman! Ha Ifm a n! Ha 1fm a n! \"', 'Tyrion turned his courser in a circle to look over the field. The ground was rolling and uneven here; soft', 'and muddy near the river, rising in a gentle slope toward the kingsroad, stony and broken beyond it, to', 'the cast. A few trees spotted the hillsides, but most of the land had been cleared and planted. His heart', 'pounded in his chest in time to the drums, and under his layers of leather and steel his brow was cold with', 'sweat. He watched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the line, shouting and gesticulating.', 'This wing too was all cavalry, but where the right was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers, the', 'vanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west: mounted archers', 'in leather jerkins, a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and sellswords, fieldhands on plow horses', \"armed with scythes and their fathers' rusted swords, half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport and\", 'Tyrion and his mountain clansmen.', 'Crow food,\" Bronn muttered beside him, giving voice to what Tyrion had left unsaid. He could only nod.', 'Had his lord father taken leave of his senses? No pikes, too few bowmen, a bare handful of knights, the', 'ill-armed and unarmored, commanded by an unthinking brute who led with his rage . . . how could his', 'father expect this travesty of a battle to hold his left?', 'He had no time to think about it. The drums were so near that the beat crept under his skin and set his', 'hands to twitching. Bronn drew his longsword, and suddenly the enemy was there before them, boiling', 'over the tops of the hills, advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes.', 'Gods be damned, look at them all, Tyrion thought, though he knew his father had more men on the field.', 'Their captains led them on armored warhorses, standard-bearers riding alongside with their banners. He', \"glimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods, the Karstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn's battle-axe, and the\", \"mailed fist of the Glovers . . . and the twin towers of Frey, blue on grey. So much for his father's certainty\", 'that Lord Walder would not bestir himself. The white of House Stark was seen everywhere, the grey', 'direwolves seeming to run and leap as the banners swirled and streamed from the high staffs. \"ere is the', 'boy? Tyrion wondered.', 'A warhorn blew. Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo, it cried, its voice as long and low and chilling as a', 'cold wind from the north. The Lannister trumpets answered, da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAAAA,', 'brazen and defiant, yet it seemed to Tyrion that they sounded somehow smaller, more anxious. He could', 'feel a fluttering in his bowels, a queasy liquid feeling; he hoped he was not going to die sick.', 'Page 459', '', 'As the horns died away, a hissing filled the air; a vast flight of arrows arched up from his right, where the', 'archers stood flanking the road. The northerners broke into a run, shouting as they came, but the', 'Lannister arrows fell on them like hail, hundreds of arrows, thousands, and shouts turned to screams as', 'men stumbled and went down. By then a second flight was in the air, and the archers were fitting a third', 'arrow to their bowstrings.', 'The trumpets blared again, da-DAAA da-DAAA da-DA da-DA daDAAAAAAA. Ser Gregor waved', 'his huge sword and bellowed a command, and a thousand other voices screamed back at him. Tyrion put', 'his spurs to his horse and added one more voice to the cacophony, and', 'the van surged forward. \"The river!\" he shouted at his clansmen as they rode. \"Remember, hew to the', 'river.\" He was still leading when they broke a canter, until Chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and', 'galloped past him, and Shagga howled and followed. The clansmen charged after them, leaving Tyrion in', 'their dust.', 'A crescent of enemy spearmen had formed ahead, a double hedgehog bristling with steel, waiting behind', 'tall oaken shields marked with the sunburst of Karstark. Gregor Clegane was the first to reach them,', 'leading a wedge of armored veterans. Half the horses shied at the last second, breaking their charge', 'before the row of spears. The others died, sharp steel points ripping through their chests. Tyrion saw a', \"dozen men go down. The Mountain's stallion reared, lashing out with iron-shod hooves as a barbed\", 'spearhead raked across his neck. Maddened, the beast lunged into the ranks. Spears thrust at him from', 'every side, but the shield wall broke beneath his weight. The northerners stumbled away from the', \"animal's death throes. As his horse fell, snorting blood and biting with his last red breath, the Mountain\", 'rose untouched, laying about him with his two-handed greatsword.', 'Shagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close, other Stone Crows hard behind', 'him. Tyrion shouted, \"Burned Men! Moon Brothers! After me!\" but most of them were ahead of him. He', 'glimpsed Timett son of Timett vault free as his mount died under him in full stride, saw a Moon Brother', \"impaled on a Karstark spear, watched Conn's horse shatter a man's ribs with a kick. A flight of arrows\", 'descended on them; where they came from he could not say, but they fell on Stark and Lannister alike,', 'rattling off armor or finding flesh. Tyrion lifted his shield and hid beneath it.', 'The hedgehog was crumbling, the northerners reeling back under the impact of the mounted assault.', 'Tyrion saw Shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the fool came on at a run, saw his axe shear', 'through mail and leather and muscle and lungs. The man was dead on his feet, the axehead lodged in his', 'breast, yet Shagga rode on, cleaving a shield in two with his left-hand battle-axe while the corpse was', 'bouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on his right. Finally the dead man slid off. Shagga smashed the', 'two axes together and roared.', \"By then the enemy was on him, and Tyrion's battle shrunk to the few feet of ground around his horse. A\", 'man-at-arms thrust at his chest and his axe lashed out, knocking the spear aside. The man danced back', 'for another try, but Tyrion spurred his horse and rode right over him. Bronn was surrounded by three', 'foes, but he lopped the head off the first spear that came at him, and raked his blade across a second', \"man's face on his backslash.\", 'A thrown spear came hurtling at Tyrion from the left and lodged in his shield with a woody chunk.

He was tall and spare, wearing a long chainmail hauberk and', \"gauntlets of lobstered steel, but he'd lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across\", 'his forehead. Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face, but the tall man slammed it aside. \"Dwarf,\" he screamed.', '\"Die.\" He turned in a circle as Tyrion rode around him, hacking at his head and shoulders. Steel rang on', 'steel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was. Where in the', 'seven hells was Bronn? \"Die,\" the man grunted, chopping at him savagely. Tyrion barely got his shield up', 'in time, and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow. The shattered pieces fell', 'away from his arm. \"Die!\" the swordsman bellowed, shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the', 'temple so hard his head rang. The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the', \"steel. The tall man grinned . . . until Tyrion's destrier bit, quick as a snake, laying his cheek bare to the\", 'bone.

Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for', 'Bronn. His right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint.', 'His axe was gone, as fast as that. He clawed for his sword, but the morningstar was circling again,', 'coming at his face. A sickening crunch, and he was falling.

He rolled onto his side and', 'tried to find his feet, but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed. The knight who had felled', 'him drew up above him. \"Tyrion the Imp,\" he boomed down. \"You are mine. Do you yield, Lannister?\"', 'Yes, Tyrion thought, but the word caught in his throat. He made a croaking sound and fought his way to', 'his knees, fumbling for a weapon. His sword, his dirk, anything . . .', '\"Do you yield?\" The knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse.

Five hundred knights surrounded him, sunlight flashing off the', 'points of their lances. The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their', 'charge.', 'With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor, Tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter.

Tyrion thought they\", 'were both dead, but as he dismounted, Shagga opened his eyes and said, \"They have killed Conn son of', 'Coratt.\" Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast, where the spear thrust had', 'killed him. When Bronn pulled Shagga to his feet, the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first', 'time. He plucked them out one by one, cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather,', 'and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh. Chella daughter of Cheyk rode', 'up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed them four ears she had taken. Timett they', 'discovered looting the bodies of the slain with his Burned Men. Of the three hundred clansmen who had', 'ridden to battle behind Tyrion Lannister, perhaps half had survived.', 'He left the living to look after the dead, sent Bronn to take charge of his captive knight, and went alone', 'in search of his father.

They could not keep it secret, and Dany knew what that meant. A khal who could not', 'ride could not rule, and Drogo had fallen from his horse.', '\"We must bathe him,\" she said stubbornly. She must not allow herself to despair. \"Irri, have the tub', 'brought at once.

Dany fell', 'to her knees, crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within. \"Stop him,\" she commanded her', 'khas, \"kill him.\"', 'Rakharo and Quaro stood beside the tent flap. Quaro took a step forward, reaching for the handle of his', 'whip, but Qotho spun graceful as a dancer, the curved arakh rising. It caught Quaro low under the arm,', 'the bright sharp steel biting up through leather and skin, through muscle and rib bone. Blood fountained', 'as the young rider reeled backward, gasping.', 'Page 477', '', 'Qotho wrenched the blade free. \"Horselord,\" Ser Jorah Mormont called. \"Try me.\" His longsword slid', 'from its scabbard.', \"Qotho whirled, cursing. The arakh moved so fast that Quaro's blood flew from it in a fine spray, like rain\", \"in a hot wind.

The knight was clad in chainmail, with gauntlets and greaves of lobstered steel and', 'a heavy gorget around his throat, but he had not thought to don his helm.', 'Qotho danced backward, arakh whirling around his head in a shining blur, flickering out like lightning as', 'the knight came on in a rush. Ser Jorah parried as best he could, but the slashes came so fast that it', 'seemed to Dany that Qotho had four arakhs and as many arms. She heard the crunch of sword on mail,', 'saw sparks fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet. Suddenly it was Mormont stumbling', \"backward, and Qotho leaping to the attack. The left side of the knight's face ran red with blood, and a\", 'cut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left him limping. Qotho screamed taunts at him, calling him a', 'craven, a milk man, a eunuch in an iron suit. \"You die now!\" he promised, arakh shivering through the red', \"twilight. Inside Dany's womb, her son kicked wildly. The curved blade slipped past the straight one and\", \"bit deep into the knight's hip where the mail gaped open.\", 'Mormont grunted, stumbled. Dany felt a sharp pain in her belly, a wetness on her thighs. Qotho shrieked', 'triumph, but his arakh had found bone, and for half a heartbeat it caught.', 'It was enough. Ser Jorah brought his longsword down with all the strength left him, through flesh and', \"muscle and bone, and Qotho's forearm dangled loose, flopping on a thin cord of skin and sinew. The\", \"knight's next cut was at the Dothraki's ear, so savage that Qotho's face seemed almost to explode.\", 'The Dothraki were shouting, Mirri Maz Duur wailing inside the tent like nothing human, Quaro pleading', 'for water as he died.

A\", 'yank, and the bloodrider stumbled backward, losing his feet and his sword. Rakharo sprang forward,', \"howling, swinging his arakh down with both hands through the top of Haggo's head.

Some were saddling horses and riding off. The sun', 'had set. Fires burned throughout the khalasar, great orange blazes that crackled with fury and spit', \"embers at the sky.

Are they all so afraid? She knew the', 'Page 478', '', 'answer. Another pain grasped her, and Dany bit back a scream.

Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and she knew what they were', \"thinking. With others, she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers; she didn't know what\", 'they were thinking, and that scared her even more. A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys', 'and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her.', \"The silver bracelet she'd hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle, along with her\", 'bundle of good clothes, snatched', 'while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled', \"in, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword . . . and Needle. She'd been lying on top of\", 'Needle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together. Since then', 'Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her', 'hip. The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off', \"robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn't have been scared off if she'd had a\", 'battle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread. Often as not, she went to', 'bed hungry rather than risk the stares.', 'Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and', 'cherries. Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south. And she could dig for', 'roots in the forest, even run down some rabbits. In the city, the only things to run down were rats and', \"cats and scrawny dogs. The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, she'd heard,\", \"but she didn't like to think about that.\", 'Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets. Arya scrambled through', 'the crowds, trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks. She had learned to keep to the', 'Page 481', '', 'center of the street. Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them', \"coming. If you walked near the buildings, people grabbed you. In some alleys you couldn't help but brush\", 'against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met.', 'A whooping gang of small children went running past, chasing a rolling hoop. Arya stared at them with', \"resentment, remembering the times she'd played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother\", 'Rickon. She wondered how big Rickon had grown, and whether Bran was sad. She would have given', 'anything if Jon had been here to call her \"little sister\" and muss her hair. Not that it needed mussing. She\\'d', \"seen her reflection in puddles, and she didn't think hair got any more mussed than hers.\", 'She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give her a', 'place to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or something. The little ones only looked at her with', 'quick, wary eyes and ran away if she came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions', \"Arya couldn't answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her. Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot\", 'girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a', 'crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding.', 'A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it', 'thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think of the sea. Maybe that was', 'the way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into', 'all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. She decided to visit the riverfront. It was on the', \"way to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn't checked that one today.\", 'The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side', 'by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her. Half the stalls were empty, and', 'it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three', \"of the king's war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and\", 'fell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river.', 'When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, her heart', \"almost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell's colors brought tears to her eyes. Behind them, a\", 'sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings. Arya could not read the name painted on the', 'hull; the words were strange, Myrish, Braavosi, perhaps even High Valyrian. She grabbed a passing', 'longshoreman by the sleeve. \"Please,\" she said, \"what ship is this?\"', '\"She\\'s the Wind Witch, out of Myr,\" the man said.', '\"She\\'s still here,\" Arya blurted. The longshoreman gave her a queer look, shrugged, and walked away.', 'Arya ran toward the pier. The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home . . . still', \"waiting! She'd imagined it had sailed ages ago.\", 'Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of', 'his sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, she stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes her', 'eyes her eyes, why did . . .', 'Look with your eyes, she heard Syrio whisper.', 'Arya looked. She knew all of her father\\'s men. The three in the grey cloaks were strangers. \"You,\" the', 'one walking rounds called out. \"What do you want here, boy?\" The other two looked up from their dice.', 'Page 482', '', 'It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run, but she knew that if she did, they would be after her at', \"once.

She'd be\", 'a boy, then. \"Want to buy a pigeon?\" She showed him the dead bird.', '\"Get out of here,\" the guardsman said.', 'Arya did as he told her. She did not have to pretend to be frightened. Behind her, the men went back to', 'their dice.', 'She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom, but she was breathing hard by the time she', 'reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills. The Bottom had a stench to it, a stink of', \"pigsties and stables and tanner's sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap\", 'whorehouses. Arya wound her way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a wWiff of', 'bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone. It must have', \"slipped from her belt as she ran, or someone had stolen it and she'd never noticed. For a moment she\", \"wanted to cry again. She'd have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that\", 'plump.', 'Far across the city, bells began to ring.', 'Arya glanced up, listening, wondering what the ringing meant this time.', '\"What\\'s this now?\" a fat man called from the pot-shop.', '\"The bells again, gods ha\\'mercy,\" wailed an old woman.', 'A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a secondstory window. \"Is it the boy king', 'that\\'s died now?\" she shouted down, leaning out over the street. \"Ah, that\\'s a boy for you, they never last', 'long.\" As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the', 'heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift.', '\"Stupid slut,\" the fat man shouted up. \"The king\\'s not dead, that\\'s only summoning bells. One tower', 'tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.\"', '\"Here, quit your biting, or I\\'ll ring your bells,\" the woman in the window said to the man behind her,', 'pushing him off with an elbow. \"So who is it died, if not the king?\"', '\"It\\'s a summoning,\" the fat man repeated.', \"Two boys close to Arya's age scampered past, splashing through a puddle. The old woman cursed\", 'them, but they kept right on going. Other people were moving too, heading up the hill to see what the', 'noise was about. Arya ran after the slower boy. \"Where you going?\" she shouted when she was right', 'behind him. \"What\\'s happening?\"', 'He glanced back without slowing. \"The gold cloaks is carryin\\' him to the sept.\"', '\"Who?\" she yelled, running hard.', 'Page 483', '', '\"The Hand! They\\'ll be taking his head off, Buu says.\"', 'A passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street. The boy leapt over, but Arya never saw it. She tripped', 'and fell, face first, scraping her', 'knee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth. Needle', 'tangled between her legs. She sobbed as she struggled to her knees. The thumb of her left hand was', 'covered with blood. When she sucked on it, she saw that half the thumbnail was gone, ripped off in her', 'fall. Her hands throbbed, and her knee was all bloody too.', '\"Make way!\" someone shouted from the cross street. \"Make wayfor my lords of Red4yne!\" It was all', 'Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down, four guardsmen on huge horses,', 'pounding past at a gallop. They wore checked cloaks, blue-and-burgundy. Behind them, two young', 'lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod. Arya had seen them in the', 'bailey a hundred times; the Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, homely youths with orange hair', 'and square, freckled faces. Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and', 'giggle whenever they caught sight of them. They did not look funny now.', 'Everyone was moving in the same direction, all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about. The bells', 'seemed louder now, clanging, calling. Arya joined the stream of people. Her thumb hurt so bad where', 'the nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry.

From the middle of the crowd, all she could see were arms and legs and stomachs, and the seven', 'slender towers of the sept looming overhead. She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the', 'back where she might be able to see, but others had the same idea. The teamster cursed at them and', 'drove them off with a crack of his whip.', 'Arya grew frantic. Forcing her way to the front of the crowd, she was shoved up against the stone of a', 'plinth.

His queen mother stood beside him in a black', 'mourning gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in her hair. Arya recognized the Hound,', 'wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him. She saw', 'Varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe, and she thought', 'the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for', 'Mother.', 'And there in their midst was Sansa, dressed in sky-blue silk, with her long auburn hair washed and', 'curled and silver bracelets on her', 'wrists. Arya scowled, wondering what her sister was doing here, why she looked so happy.', 'A long line of gold-cloaked spearmen held back the crowd, commanded by a stout man in elaborate', 'armor, all black lacquer and gold filigree. His cloak had the metallic shimmer of true cloth-of-gold.', 'When the bell ceased to toll, a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza, and her father lifted his head', 'and began to speak, his voice so thin and weak she could scarcely make him out. People behind her', 'began to shout out, \"What?\" and \"Louder!\" The man in the black-andgold armor stepped up behind', 'Father and prodded him sharply. You leave him alone! Arya wanted to shout, but she knew no one', 'Page 485', '', 'would listen. She chewed her lip.', 'Her father raised his voice and began again. \"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the', 'King,\" he said more loudly, his voice carrying across the plaza, \"and I come before you to confess my', 'treason in the sight of gods and men.\"', '\"No, \" Arya whimpered. Below her, the crowd began to scream and shout. Taunts and obscenities filled', 'the air. Sansa had hidden her face in her hands.', 'Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. \"I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust', 'of my friend, Robert,\" he shouted. \"I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his blood was', 'cold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for myself.

Arya cried out as she saw her father hit. The gold cloaks kept', 'him from falling. Blood ran down his face from a deep gash across his forehead. More stones followed.', \"One struck the guard to Father's left. Another went clanging off the breastplate of the knight in the\", 'black-and-gold armor.

Lords and knights moved aside as he stepped', \"through, tall and fleshless, a skeleton in iron mail, the King's Justice. Dimly, as if from far off, Arya heard\", 'her sister scream.

She heard the screams', 'of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah', 'calling her name and cursing.
