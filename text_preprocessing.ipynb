directed. every single scene is underlighted, including those very few that are shot during the daytime. it doesn't matter what the location is. at an important conference in the white house, no lights are on, and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows. the primier of china conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of homer in a rembrandt painting. honest. it's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness. the slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill-thought-out movie.roy scheider and maria conchita alonzo do well by their roles, but scheider is rarely on screen. the other performances are dismissable. there is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a bond movie who's accent suggests a childhood spent in basset, nebraska, and who should have remained the model she probably started out as. whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like johnny depp, not because of any display of talent. the chinese villains, representing both taiwan and mainland china, hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes. the script is pretty awful, recycled from other, better films. there is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat. two thirds of the way through, the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs. then the movie splits into two related parts. part one, another shootout, this time in a waterfront warehouse. part two, an exchange between the vice president, now acting president, and the oily chinese premiere, lifted out of both \\\"dr. strangelove\\\" and \\\"fail safe.\\\" we unwittingly launch our missiles. they launch theirs in retaliation. we cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. there is even the george c. scott/ walter matthau general who argues that their \\\"nucular\\\" armory can't match ours so we should hit them with everything we've got. more fireballs. the end comes none too soon.\",\n          \"in sri lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek, winner of several awards at the national film awards in india. while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka. played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p.s. keerthana in a memorable performance, amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama (nandita das) and dileepan (j.d. chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red cross camp. in a loving flashback, we see amudha's adoptive parents, father thiru (madhavan) a prominent tamil writer, and mother indra (simran) a tv personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. while she is playing, thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that \\\"you are not our daughter\\\" and the response is predictable. distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the tamil separatists. the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a. r. rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich\\u00e9d and commercial, yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.\",\n          \"futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s (the origins of off off broadway). though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution. the story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. on the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in america.the stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the u.s. and europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, tom o'horgan (who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway).this is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. and it just might change the way you see
